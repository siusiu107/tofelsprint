Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Hey—quick question about Fault creep versus stick-slip earthquakes. I'm not totally lost, I guess, it's just… the little rules. Like, kind of, the fault plane part seems fine, but then the policy mentions tomography and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, uh, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, book something, or fix something? Because seismic wave matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: Um, Here’s the catch. It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, kind of, they pause the workflow. If it's late, you know, they bump you to the next review cycle.
Student 2: Honestly, I guess, do it in one clean batch. Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Wait, random question—has Professor Lee been okay? They looked… exhausted last class.
Student 2: For reimbursements, like, there's always some weird rule. Kind of, Talk to the student activities office.
Student 1: Um, Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, I guess, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
