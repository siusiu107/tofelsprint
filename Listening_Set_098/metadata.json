  "detail1": "The professor distinguishes lattice (a process) from Cooper pair (a proxy/measurement).",
  "detail2": "He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving defect and critical temperature.",
  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",

  "connecting_point": "The example about controlling for phase transition shows how bias can flip an apparent pattern.",
