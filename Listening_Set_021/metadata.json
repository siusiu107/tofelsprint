  "main_point": "The professor explains Ground-penetrating radar in site mapping and how to interpret evidence when measurements can be misleading.",
  "detail1": "The professor distinguishes radiocarbon dating (a process) from typology (a proxy/measurement).",
  "detail2": "He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving assemblage and stratigraphy.",
  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",
  "organization_point": "He adds a tangent about a tools tangent to show real-world constraints.",
  "connecting_point": "The example about controlling for dendrochronology shows how bias can flip an apparent pattern.",
