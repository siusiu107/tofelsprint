Passage 0021: Place Cells and How Brains Build Usable Space (Neuroscience)
==========================================================================
(Word count: 681)

A rat released into a new maze does not move like a bead sliding down a wire. It pauses,
reorients, returns to corners, and gradually begins to take shortcuts that were not
explicitly taught. For neuroscientists, this behavioral fluency raised a question: how can a
brain represent a space well enough to support both exploration and efficient travel? One
influential answer comes from the hippocampus, where certain neurons—“place cells”—fire when
an animal occupies a particular location. A place cell does not label “north” or “two meters
from the wall” in words; instead, it becomes active when the animal is in its preferred
region, as if the neuron were a tiny beacon that lights up in that spot.

The basic phenomenon is deceptively simple. Recordings from a moving animal show that a
single hippocampal neuron may fire rapidly in one corridor segment and remain quiet
elsewhere. Different neurons prefer different segments, and the ensemble activity resembles
a patchwork of overlapping fields. [A] Because fields overlap, the brain is not forced to
rely on one neuron per location; it can infer position from patterns, improving robustness
when signals are noisy. If one field shifts slightly, others can still constrain the
animal’s inferred location.

Place fields are not painted onto the hippocampus by the walls of the maze alone. They
depend on inputs that carry distance and direction information, including signals from head-
direction cells and from grid cells in nearby regions. Grid cells fire in multiple locations
that form a repeating lattice across an environment, and their periodic pattern can be
combined to estimate displacement, much as two overlapping rhythms can create a slower
“beat” that marks progress. When grid-based estimates are aligned with landmarks, place
fields can become stable. When landmarks are removed or rotated, fields can drift, revealing
that the map is constructed from multiple cues rather than copied from a single sensory
channel.

The map is also plastic. If a barrier is inserted into a familiar arena, some place cells
maintain their fields while others “remap,” switching to new preferred locations. Remapping
is not random; it reflects how the animal parses the space. When a room is divided by a
screen, the brain may treat the two sides as distinct contexts, even if the physical
distance is small. Conversely, when two corridors share similar geometry, fields can become
ambiguous, and the animal may make navigation errors that mirror that ambiguity. [B] In
these cases, mistakes are informative: they indicate the map’s limits rather than mere
clumsiness.

A cognitive map must also interact with goals. When a hungry rat searches for food, it does
not merely represent where it is; it must select where to go. Hippocampal activity can
reflect this selection through sequences. During pauses or sleep, neurons can fire in rapid
patterns that resemble trajectories through the environment, as if the brain were rehearsing
paths. Some sequences correspond to routes the animal previously traveled; others appear to
represent shortcuts or alternatives, implying that the map can be used generatively, not
only descriptively. The causal significance is that a representation of space becomes useful
when it can be run forward to evaluate possibilities.

Human navigation adds another layer: language, plans, and cultural tools. Yet the underlying
need is shared. A person finding a seat in a dark theater uses a mixture of cues—counting
rows, recognizing aisles, correcting after a misstep. Neuropsychological cases in which
hippocampal damage impairs flexible navigation while sparing some habits suggest that maps
and routines are separable. [C] A routine can say, “turn right at the corner,” but a map can
say, “if the corner is blocked, there is another path around.”

Thus, place cells do not provide a complete story of navigation, but they offer a concrete
mechanism by which a brain can encode location and use that encoding to support memory and
planning. [D] A maze becomes more than walls when the nervous system can transform movement
and landmarks into a structured internal space—one that can be revisited, revised, and
mentally traversed before the feet commit to a turn.


Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] The word “ensemble” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a group acting together
   B. a fixed barrier
   C. a single cue
   D. an error pattern

2. [Factual] According to the passage, what is a defining feature of hippocampal place cells?
   A. They fire preferentially when the animal is in a particular location
   B. They fire only during sleep and never during movement
   C. They encode only compass direction and not position
   D. They fire in perfectly periodic lattices across space

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In that sense, location is encoded redundantly rather than by a lone indicator.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why navigation errors in similar-looking corridors are “informative”?
   A. They reveal that the internal map can be ambiguous when geometric cues are confusable
   B. They show that place cells stop firing permanently in corridors
   C. They prove that landmarks are irrelevant to mapping
   D. They indicate that remapping occurs only in humans

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention grid cells?
   A. To explain that place fields draw on distance-and-direction computations that can be aligned with landmarks
   B. To argue that grid cells replace the hippocampus entirely
   C. To claim that all spatial coding is visual
   D. To suggest that repeating lattices are errors to be ignored

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as influences on place-field stability EXCEPT:
   A. landmarks
   B. head-direction signals
   C. grid-cell inputs
   D. plate tectonics

7. [Reference] In the passage, “this selection” refers to the animal’s need to:
   A. choose where to go to reach a goal
   B. erase all place fields after learning
   C. rotate landmarks to test drift
   D. sleep to stop firing

8. [Organization] How does the passage primarily develop its explanation?
   A. By defining place cells, describing cue integration and remapping, then linking maps to goal-directed sequences and flexible navigation
   B. By listing maze designs without neural evidence
   C. By focusing only on human language
   D. By describing a single experiment without general principles

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the contrast between a routine and a map?
   A. A routine follows a learned turn-by-turn script, while a map supports flexible detours when conditions change
   B. A map is a habit, while routines require spatial computation
   C. Routines depend on sleep sequences, while maps do not
   D. Maps prevent any navigation error from occurring

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Place cells are isolated neurons that label direction only and do not change with experience.
   B. The passage explains how place cells encode location through overlapping fields informed by multiple cues, how fields can remap as environments change, and how such representations support flexible planning through replayed sequences.
   C. Spatial behavior is governed entirely by walls, so neural signals are unnecessary.
   D. Grid cells alone explain all navigation, making the hippocampus irrelevant.
