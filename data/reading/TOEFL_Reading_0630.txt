Passage 0630: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 721)

In tectonically active margins, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated transient
surface deformation as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow
slip. Although numerical rupture simulations can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than
rely on familiar narratives.

Despite the fact that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. [A] The passage
signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. it highlights how locked versus
creeping patches can shift baselines, altering whether transient surface deformation is even
comparable across cases, a move that means that a good fit is not the same as a good
explanation. [B] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as
an embarrassment. Should locked versus creeping patches is changed while the nominal driver
remains constant be true, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are
perturbed. [C] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested. [D] Later
comparisons reveal why this matters. In this sense, megathrust rupture dynamics is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on locked versus creeping patches, the
passage suggests many early studies framed subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow
slip as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized transient surface
deformation as a signature in one account, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ in another. this shift mattered for how
evidence from the Cascadia subduction zone was generalized because, as the author notes,
local conditions can change which processes generate transient surface deformation.

Only through analysts began combining numerical rupture simulations with cross-site
comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about subduction-zone megathrust
earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which transient surface
deformation could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like locked
versus creeping patches often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which changes whether
two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, episodic tremor and slip is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify locked versus creeping
patches, does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which numerical rupture simulations constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is
precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of subduction-zone
megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is constrained by what competing models
would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the
same observation—transient surface deformation—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat transient surface
deformation as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. In this sense, slow-slip events
on plate interfaces is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Admittedly, the temptation to
treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; nevertheless, the result is a framework
in which transient surface deformation is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions
rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like locked versus creeping patches make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting inversion of seismic waveforms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats inversion of seismic waveforms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss tsunami-generating seafloor uplift or locked versus creeping patches. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because tsunami-generating seafloor uplift uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that locked versus creeping patches is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using inversion of seismic waveforms are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how locked versus creeping patches can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Sumatra–Andaman. Finally, it maintains that tests combining inversion of seismic waveforms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In short, the passage treats methodological humility as a strength, not as an admission of ignorance.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **approximate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] Later comparisons reveal why this matters.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like continuous GPS geodesy are needed
   B. rough
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because heterogeneous frictional properties dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip, serving only as background detail

4. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. Because fluid overpressure in faults co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if numerical rupture simulations produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. it prevents tsunami-generating seafloor uplift from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control fluid overpressure in faults
   D. Because tsunami-generating seafloor uplift appears, the mechanism must be unique, so fluid overpressure in faults can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The author argues that numerical rupture simulations should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'megathrust rupture dynamics' refers to a different field altogether, not to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip.
   C. The passage treats low-frequency tremor bursts as a confounder and locked versus creeping patches as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where numerical rupture simulations constrains locked versus creeping patches
