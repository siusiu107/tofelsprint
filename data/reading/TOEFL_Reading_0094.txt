Passage 0094: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 736)

In twentieth-century urban histories, researchers have treated changes in neighborhood
composition as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban transformation.
Admittedly, census microdata analysis can make the pattern look unusually sharp;
nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Only when analysts began combining census microdata analysis with cross-site comparisons did
claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which changes in neighborhood composition could be explained in more than
one way because, as the author notes, confounders like wartime industry demand often co-vary
with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, african american internal migration is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Using census microdata analysis under stable conditions, the author treats the complication
as diagnostic, so one frequently cited case from Philadelphia appeared to support the
direct-readout view. Though the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in wartime industry demand altered the baseline enough
to mute or mimic changes in neighborhood composition. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, which helps explain why illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify wartime
industry demand. [A] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating them as
afterthoughts. by comparing cases in which census microdata analysis constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, something that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] This reasoning
matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test. While it is true that a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. [C] The argument hinges on what would change under
an alternative explanation. [D] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders
enter the pipeline. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on wartime industry demand, it is difficult
to deny that many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban transformation
as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized changes in neighborhood
composition as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under replication. The
passage argues that this shift mattered for how evidence from Philadelphia was generalized
because local conditions can change which processes generate changes in neighborhood
composition.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration
and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by what competing models would
also predict. Provided that one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the
same observation—changes in neighborhood composition—must be paired with tests that change
the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat changes in
neighborhood composition as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically
revealing. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record
can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Admittedly, the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; nevertheless, the result
is a framework in which changes in neighborhood composition is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. segregation and redlining signatures specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. housing covenants and policy constraints alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. newspaper archive research as a device rather than as an analytic approach

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because segregation and redlining signatures uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates wartime industry demand.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Chicago and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on oral history synthesis simple.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that shifts in industrial labor demand is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how wartime industry demand can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Detroit. Finally, it maintains that tests combining census microdata analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   B. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like wartime industry demand make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting census microdata analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats census microdata analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifts in industrial labor demand or wartime industry demand. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that wartime industry demand is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using census microdata analysis are unnecessary.

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. The passage implies that Philadelphia is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The discussion suggests that housing covenants and policy constraints is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The author argues that oral history synthesis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where oral history synthesis constrains housing covenants and policy constraints

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | census microdata analysis | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | shifts in industrial labor demand | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | wartime industry demand | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It makes wartime industry demand irrelevant.
   B. Samples only part of the system
   C. Can be contaminated by background variability
   D. Shifts the baseline

6. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This is why the author dwells on assumptions: without them, two teams can analyze the same record and still disagree honestly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

7. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. Because wartime industry demand co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents segregation and redlining signatures from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control wartime industry demand
   C. Since segregation and redlining signatures is observed in Detroit, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once segregation and redlining signatures is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

8. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **persistent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify wartime industry demand.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because housing covenants and policy constraints dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like census microdata analysis are needed
   C. lasting
   D. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail

9. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away push–pull dynamics, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using labor market inference from wage series.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when push–pull dynamics can mimic segregation and redlining signatures.
   D. The passage suggests that segregation and redlining signatures is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

10. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. housing record reconstruction
   B. the price of coal in 1700
   C. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
