Passage 0094: Fresco as Chemistry: Carbonation, Pigments, and Wall Physics (Art Materials)
==========================================================================================
(Word count: 607)

A fresco looks like paint, yet it is more accurately a chemical event. In true fresco (buon
fresco), pigment is applied to wet lime plaster, and as the plaster dries it undergoes
carbonation: calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in air to form calcium carbonate.
Because pigment particles become embedded in this forming crystalline matrix, the image is
not simply laid on a wall; it is locked into the wall’s mineral skin. The durability of
Renaissance murals owes much to that mineralization, even though time still alters what the
eye sees.

The process begins with plaster preparation. Lime putty is mixed with sand to create an
intonaco layer, spread in sections that a painter can complete before drying. Artists work
“a giornata,” a day’s portion, because once the surface sets, pigments will no longer bond
in the same way. [A] While the plaster remains alkaline and moist, pigments must tolerate
high pH, which immediately rules out some colors that behave well in oil but degrade in
lime.

Many stable fresco pigments are earth-based. Iron oxides yield reds, browns, and yellows;
carbon black provides deep blacks; and certain green earth minerals can survive alkalinity.
Other pigments are more delicate. Ultramarine, derived historically from lapis lazuli, could
be used, but its cost and handling made it special. Copper-based greens, by contrast, can
react under alkaline conditions, shifting hue or forming dark products. Even when pigments
remain chemically stable, the optical environment changes as the plaster carbonates, because
the refractive index and microstructure evolve, affecting how light scatters from pigment
grains.

A fresco’s appearance is also shaped by the wall behind it. Moisture migration can carry
salts to the surface. When salts crystallize, they expand, pushing apart the plaster and
creating flaking or powdering. This “efflorescence” can bleach colors or detach entire
sections. [B] The cause is often not artistic technique but building physics: rising damp,
leaks, or condensation cycles. The microclimate of a chapel—temperature swings, candle soot,
and airflow—can similarly darken surfaces or deposit particles that mute color contrast.

Restoration introduces additional complexities. Cleaning can remove soot and reveal original
tones, but aggressive solvents or abrasion can also remove the thin pigment-rich surface,
especially if the fresco was modified with secco painting (pigment applied to dry plaster
with an organic binder). Because secco layers sit on top rather than within the carbonate
matrix, they are more vulnerable, yet they were often used for details and for pigments
unsuitable for wet lime. A restorer must therefore identify which layers are integral to the
original technique and which are later additions.

The chemical underpinning explains why fresco can outlast many panel paintings. The image is
essentially a mineral composite. Yet the same chemistry that grants longevity imposes
constraints: an alkaline substrate limits pigment choices, and the wall’s moisture regime
can become the true enemy. [C] In that light, the history of a fresco is the history of a
building, because the mural’s stability is inseparable from the stone and air around it.

Fresco thus dramatizes a broader truth about art materials. [D] What we call “color” is an
interaction among pigments, binders, and environmental chemistry, and the wall remembers
every interaction long after the painter’s brush has left the plaster.

Because the wall itself becomes the binding medium, fresco is less a layer on stone than a
chemical transformation within it.

Because the wall itself becomes the binding medium, fresco is less a layer on stone than a
chemical transformation within it.

Because the wall itself becomes the binding medium, fresco is less a layer on stone than a

Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, what chemical reaction helps lock pigments into true fresco?
   A. carbonation of lime plaster, where calcium hydroxide reacts with CO2 to form calcium carbonate
   B. polymerization of oil that creates a flexible film
   C. fermentation of pigments by microbes to produce color
   D. melting of basalt that traps crystals in columns

2. [Vocabulary] The word “efflorescence” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. salt crystals forming on or near the surface that can damage plaster
   B. a deliberate decorative pattern painted on dry walls
   C. a method of steering by star rising points
   D. a sudden currency reform that stops inflation

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: That schedule forces planning, because composition and color decisions must be executed before the surface loses its receptive state.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why some pigments were applied in secco rather than buon fresco?
   A. Because certain pigments degrade in wet alkaline plaster, so artists added them later on dry surfaces using binders
   B. Because secco pigments become embedded more deeply than fresco pigments
   C. Because carbonation prevents any color from being visible
   D. Because secco is required for all earth pigments

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss moisture migration and building physics?
   A. To show that environmental conditions such as damp and salt movement can be primary causes of fresco deterioration
   B. To claim that pigment chemistry is irrelevant to fresco appearance
   C. To argue that restorers should always repaint murals completely
   D. To suggest that frescoes are immune to microclimate changes

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as factors that can alter a fresco’s appearance EXCEPT:
   A. salt crystallization
   B. candle soot deposition
   C. changes during carbonation affecting light scattering
   D. plasmid transfer between bacteria

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the wall remembers” refers to:
   A. the way environmental chemistry and moisture history leave lasting effects on pigment and plaster
   B. the ability of stone to store sound for navigation
   C. a legal document that records fishing rights
   D. a telescope that records exoplanet transits

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains the fresco process and chemistry, then discusses pigment constraints, environmental damage mechanisms, restoration issues, and the dependence of murals on building conditions
   B. It lists painters by century without mentioning materials
   C. It argues that all mural damage is caused by vandalism only
   D. It provides recipes for oil paints rather than fresco

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that fresco is “a chemical event”?
   A. Pigments become embedded as wet lime plaster carbonates into a mineral matrix, so the image forms through material transformation
   B. Artists mix pigments with water only, and the wall never changes
   C. The brush strokes are preserved because plaster stays wet permanently
   D. Color comes solely from light and not from materials

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Fresco is described as fragile because pigments sit loosely on top of the wall with no bonding process.
   B. The passage explains true fresco as pigment applied to wet lime plaster that carbonates into calcium carbonate, embedding color in a mineral matrix; it notes constraints imposed by alkalinity on pigment choice, describes deterioration from moisture and salt efflorescence as well as soot and microclimate effects, and shows how restoration must account for differences between buon fresco and secco layers tied to the building’s environmental history.
   C. Fresco is said to depend mainly on magnetic fields and therefore changes with latitude.
   D. The passage argues that restoration is unnecessary because frescoes cannot be damaged by salts.
