Passage 0033: Prince Rupert’s Drops and How Tempering Turns Stress into Strength (Materials Science)
====================================================================================================
(Word count: 626)

A glass bead dropped into cold water usually cools, hardens, and remains unremarkable. A
Prince Rupert’s drop, however, behaves like a paradox. Its bulbous head can survive hammer
blows, yet if the thin tail is snapped, the entire drop disintegrates into a shower of
glittering fragments in a fraction of a second. The spectacle is not magic; it is the
physics of stress trapped inside a solid.

The drop is made by dripping molten glass into water. The surface cools and solidifies
almost instantly, while the interior remains hot and fluid for longer. As the interior
eventually cools, it wants to contract, but the already-rigid outer shell restrains it. The
result is a stress pattern: the surface is locked in compression, while the interior is
locked in tension. Compression at the surface is protective because cracks have difficulty
opening against compressive forces. Tension inside is dangerous because, once a crack
penetrates the compressive layer, it can accelerate through a stored energy reservoir. [A]
The drop is thus an object whose strength and fragility are two sides of the same cooling
history.

Tempered glass used in car windows and shower doors exploits the same principle
deliberately. Manufacturers heat a sheet of glass and then cool its surfaces rapidly with
air jets. The surfaces harden first and end up in compression, while the core is in tension.
If the glass breaks, it tends to crumble into small, blunt pieces rather than into long,
sharp shards, because the internal tension encourages many cracks to form simultaneously,
fragmenting the sheet. This “safe breakage” reduces injury risk, even though it is violent
at the microscopic scale.

The tail of a Prince Rupert’s drop is the weak link because it provides a route to the
interior. A small notch in the tail can act as a crack starter. When the tail snaps, the
crack can quickly pierce the compressive skin and reach the tensile core. Once that happens,
the internal stress drives a crack front that races through the drop faster than sound in
the glass. High-speed videos show a branching network: the crack does not remain a single
line but splits repeatedly, creating myriad fragments. [B] In effect, the drop converts
stored elastic energy into new surface area, and that conversion is sudden because the
energy was trapped when the glass froze.

Engineers care about these stress profiles because they can be tuned. If the compressive
layer is thick, a crack must travel farther before reaching the tensile core, improving
strength. If cooling is uneven, stress can become asymmetric, creating weak zones. Surface
scratches matter enormously because they act as stress concentrators. A tiny scratch can
locally amplify stress at its tip, making it easier for a crack to initiate. This is why a
tempered glass panel can be surprisingly strong when pristine yet fail from a small chip at
the edge. [C] The failure is not a sign that the material was “weak”; it is a sign that
fracture is governed by local geometry in the presence of global stress.

The same logic appears in other engineered materials. Prestressed concrete uses steel
tendons to place concrete in compression, improving its ability to resist tensile cracking.
Even biological materials exploit compressive skins: the outer layers of bones and shells
can carry compressive loads while inner layers distribute forces. In each case, strength is
less about having no defects than about making defects harder to activate.

Prince Rupert’s drops therefore function as a compact lesson in fracture mechanics. [D]
Cooling can lock a material into a state that hides energy, and the release of that energy
can be either beneficial—as in safe fragmentation—or catastrophic when a small crack finds
the one path that unlocks the interior tension.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "amplify" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: A tiny scratch can locally amplify stress at its tip, making it easier for a crack to initiate.
   A. make larger or more intense, as used to describe how the claim holds across compressive
   B. weaken substantially, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. treat as irrelevant, despite references to stress and crack, as framed by the author, especially regarding surface.
   D. close the question permanently, which would rule out further evaluation of compressive

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents crack as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once stress is observed, competing explanations for glass collapse. It treats compressive as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   B. The passage surveys glass but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed crack first, with stress serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats compressive as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   C. The passage concedes that stress is often incomplete and concludes that glass cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since compressive overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of crack with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, in the cases described.
   D. The passage explains glass by linking stress to crack, and it shows why compressive changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in compressive, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of stress is enough to validate crack for glass, in the examples provided, for the phenomenon at issue.
   B. The passage treats stress primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over crack are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about glass are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. The passage implies that compressive mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes stress effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of crack no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain glass, in the examples provided.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how glass should change if compressive is altered, instead of assuming that stress has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to crack must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of glass as a factor influencing stress
   B. discussion of crack as a factor influencing stress
   C. discussion of contact-zone multilingualism as a factor influencing stress
   D. discussion of compressive as a factor influencing stress, especially regarding interior.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] Cooling can lock a material into a state that hides energy, and the release of that energy can be either beneficial—as in safe fragmentation—or catastrophic when a small crack finds the one path that unlocks the interior tension.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding crack.
   B. [D] Cooling can lock a material into a state that hides energy. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. [D] Cooling can lock a material into a state that hides energy. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because stress directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding glass.
   B. Because the presence of crack guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in compressive are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because comparability prevents crack from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold compressive constant while examining stress.
   D. Because once stress fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and compressive can be ignored without changing conclusions about glass.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | stress | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | compressive | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It proves crack is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that glass should be read alongside compressive, because stress alone does not settle what crack means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This “safe breakage” reduces injury risk, even though it is violent at the microscopic scale.
   A. the idea that If the glass breaks, it tends to crumble into small, blunt pieces rather than into long, sharp shards, because the internal tension encourages many...
   B. the idea that The tail of a Prince Rupert’s drop is the weak link because it provides a route to the interior
   C. the idea that The surfaces harden first and end up in compression, while the core is in tension, in the examples provided, in the context of the passage.
   D. the idea that The spectacle is not magic; it is the physics of stress trapped inside a solid, in the examples provided.
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses crack, so debate over stress is unnecessary noise, especially regarding interior, especially regarding glass.
   B. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of stress and crack should be abandoned altogether.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of stress lead to different conclusions about glass.
   D. to show that the term glass belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
