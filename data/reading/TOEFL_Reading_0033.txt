Passage 0033: Prince Rupert’s Drops and How Tempering Turns Stress into Strength (Materials Science)
====================================================================================================
(Word count: 626)

A glass bead dropped into cold water usually cools, hardens, and remains unremarkable. A
Prince Rupert’s drop, however, behaves like a paradox. Its bulbous head can survive hammer
blows, yet if the thin tail is snapped, the entire drop disintegrates into a shower of
glittering fragments in a fraction of a second. The spectacle is not magic; it is the
physics of stress trapped inside a solid.

The drop is made by dripping molten glass into water. The surface cools and solidifies
almost instantly, while the interior remains hot and fluid for longer. As the interior
eventually cools, it wants to contract, but the already-rigid outer shell restrains it. The
result is a stress pattern: the surface is locked in compression, while the interior is
locked in tension. Compression at the surface is protective because cracks have difficulty
opening against compressive forces. Tension inside is dangerous because, once a crack
penetrates the compressive layer, it can accelerate through a stored energy reservoir. [A]
The drop is thus an object whose strength and fragility are two sides of the same cooling
history.

Tempered glass used in car windows and shower doors exploits the same principle
deliberately. Manufacturers heat a sheet of glass and then cool its surfaces rapidly with
air jets. The surfaces harden first and end up in compression, while the core is in tension.
If the glass breaks, it tends to crumble into small, blunt pieces rather than into long,
sharp shards, because the internal tension encourages many cracks to form simultaneously,
fragmenting the sheet. This “safe breakage” reduces injury risk, even though it is violent
at the microscopic scale.

The tail of a Prince Rupert’s drop is the weak link because it provides a route to the
interior. A small notch in the tail can act as a crack starter. When the tail snaps, the
crack can quickly pierce the compressive skin and reach the tensile core. Once that happens,
the internal stress drives a crack front that races through the drop faster than sound in
the glass. High-speed videos show a branching network: the crack does not remain a single
line but splits repeatedly, creating myriad fragments. [B] In effect, the drop converts
stored elastic energy into new surface area, and that conversion is sudden because the
energy was trapped when the glass froze.

Engineers care about these stress profiles because they can be tuned. If the compressive
layer is thick, a crack must travel farther before reaching the tensile core, improving
strength. If cooling is uneven, stress can become asymmetric, creating weak zones. Surface
scratches matter enormously because they act as stress concentrators. A tiny scratch can
locally amplify stress at its tip, making it easier for a crack to initiate. This is why a
tempered glass panel can be surprisingly strong when pristine yet fail from a small chip at
the edge. [C] The failure is not a sign that the material was “weak”; it is a sign that
fracture is governed by local geometry in the presence of global stress.

The same logic appears in other engineered materials. Prestressed concrete uses steel
tendons to place concrete in compression, improving its ability to resist tensile cracking.
Even biological materials exploit compressive skins: the outer layers of bones and shells
can carry compressive loads while inner layers distribute forces. In each case, strength is
less about having no defects than about making defects harder to activate.

Prince Rupert’s drops therefore function as a compact lesson in fracture mechanics. [D]
Cooling can lock a material into a state that hides energy, and the release of that energy
can be either beneficial—as in safe fragmentation—or catastrophic when a small crack finds
the one path that unlocks the interior tension.

   A. compression
   B. pure tension
   C. no stress at all
   D. alternating magnetic domains

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention tempered glass used in windows and doors?
   A. To show that the same stress principle is applied intentionally for safety in modern engineering
   B. To argue that Prince Rupert’s drops are produced in factories today
   C. To claim that tempered glass cannot break
   D. To suggest that cooling history is irrelevant to fracture

4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The surface behaves like a tight band that squeezes the interior and resists the opening of fissures.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Inference] What can be inferred about why a small edge chip can be especially dangerous for tempered glass?
   A. It can provide a crack starter that bypasses the compressive layer and accesses the tensile core
   B. It neutralizes all internal stress by heating the glass
   C. It increases the thickness of the compressive skin
   D. It makes the glass more flexible so cracks cannot form

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as examples of using compression to resist cracking EXCEPT:
   A. tempered glass
   B. prestressed concrete
   C. outer layers of shells and bones
   D. radiocarbon calibration curves

7. [Reference] In the passage, “this ‘safe breakage’” refers to tempered glass’s tendency to:
   A. fragment into small blunt pieces rather than long sharp shards
   B. remain unbroken under any impact
   C. melt and reseal after cracking
   D. produce a single straight crack

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces a striking phenomenon, explains the stress mechanism from cooling, compares it to tempered glass, then connects the idea to crack initiation and broader engineering examples
   B. It narrates the discovery of glass chronologically only
   C. It focuses on chemical composition and ignores stress
   D. It argues that glass breaks randomly without physical explanation

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that strength and fragility are “two sides of the same cooling history”?
   A. Rapid cooling creates a compressive surface that resists cracks, but also traps internal tension that can drive explosive failure if breached
   B. Cooling makes glass chemically unstable so it shatters later
   C. Only the tail is strong while the head is weak
   D. Glass becomes stronger solely because it is thicker

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Prince Rupert’s drops shatter because glass is inherently brittle and cannot store stress.
   B. The passage explains that rapid cooling traps compressive stress at the surface and tensile stress inside, making Prince Rupert’s drops and tempered glass unusually strong against surface cracks yet capable of sudden fragmentation if a crack reaches the stressed core, illustrating how engineered stress profiles control fracture.
   C. Tempered glass breaks into long shards because internal tension prevents crack branching.
   D. Surface scratches do not matter because fractures depend only on overall thickness.
