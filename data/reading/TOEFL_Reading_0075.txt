Passage 0075: Rotating Savings Groups and Social Enforcement
============================================================
(Word count: 611)

In many places, access to formal banking is less a matter of desire than of eligibility. A
family may have irregular income, no collateral, and no credit history that a distant
institution recognizes. Yet the need to smooth consumption, pay school fees, buy inventory,
or handle emergencies remains. In response, communities have developed financial
arrangements that rely not on contracts enforced by courts but on relationships enforced by
reputation. One of the most widespread is the rotating savings and credit association, often
abbreviated as ROSCA.

A ROSCA is simple in form. A group of participants agrees to contribute a fixed amount at
regular intervals—weekly, monthly, or aligned with harvest cycles. At each meeting, the
pooled sum is given to one member, and over time each participant receives the pot once. The
sequence can be determined by lottery, by bidding, or by negotiation based on need. A member
who receives the pot early is effectively receiving an interest-free loan repaid through
later contributions; a member who receives late is effectively saving, depositing
contributions until the payout. [A] The same mechanism, therefore, can function as credit
and as saving, depending on timing.

The advantage is not that ROSCAs are mathematically sophisticated; it is that they solve
practical frictions. Because members meet regularly, contributions are observable. Social
pressure substitutes for late fees. If someone fails to pay, the default is public, and the
cost is reputational, which can be more painful than a small penalty. In communities where
people trade, work, and marry within overlapping networks, reputation is not abstract; it
affects future cooperation. This is why ROSCAs can operate with minimal paperwork. Yet this
strength is also a vulnerability. If social ties weaken—because of migration, conflict, or
anonymity in large cities—enforcement can fail.

Variation reveals what ROSCAs are designed to handle. Some groups allow members to borrow
from one another between meetings, effectively creating a small credit market. Others
require a guarantor for new members or begin with small contributions until trust is
established. In bidding ROSCAs, members bid for the pot by offering to accept a smaller
payout; the “discount” can be distributed among others, creating an implicit return for
those who wait. Such designs mimic interest without invoking a bank’s infrastructure. [B]
They also reveal that the line between “informal” and “formal” finance is not a line between
chaos and order, but a line between different enforcement technologies.

ROSCAs also produce psychological benefits. Saving in a jar can be undone by temptation, but
saving in a group creates a commitment device. The regular meeting becomes a ritual that
turns an abstract plan into a repeated action. Moreover, receiving a lump sum at a
predictable time can enable purchases that would be difficult through incremental saving,
such as a sewing machine or a small refrigerator. In that sense, a ROSCA is not merely an
account; it is a schedule of possibilities.

Risks remain. If a member receives the pot early and then disappears, later participants
bear the loss. To reduce this risk, some ROSCAs give early payouts only to highly trusted
members, or they maintain an emergency fund. External shocks can also break the system: a
drought that reduces income for everyone at once makes contributions harder precisely when
needs increase. For that reason, ROSCAs rarely replace formal insurance; they complement it
where insurance is absent.

The persistence of ROSCAs suggests a general principle about finance. [C] People need
mechanisms that transform uncertain cash flows into dependable obligations, and when
institutions do not provide those mechanisms, communities build them. [D]

When meetings are missed, the group may publicly record the absence, turning reputation into
a practical accounting tool.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, what happens at each ROSCA meeting?
   A. risks contribute a fixed amount and the pooled sum is given to one member. This would require contributions to be the limiting factor.
   B. Participants contribute a fixed amount and the pooled sum is solely given to one member. This would require reputation to be the limiting factor.
   C. Participants contribute a fixed amount and the pooled sum is given to one member. This outcome would hold even if risks stays constant.
   D. Participants contribute a fixed amount and the pooled sum is given to one member.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “collateral” in the first paragraph is closest in meaning to:
   A. property or assets pledged to secure a loan
   B. a type of lottery ticket
   C. a schedule of meeting times
   D. a public reputation record


3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the pot is large relative to any single contribution, the timing of receipt matters as much as the total amount.
   A. [B]
   B. [A]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why ROSCAs may struggle in highly anonymous urban environments?
   A. If participants lack overlapping social ties, reputational enforcement becomes weaker. This would occur only when enforcement dominates.
   B. If insurance lack overlapping social ties, reputational enforcement becomes weaker. That would make risks the primary constraint.
   C. If participants lack overlapping social ties, reputational enforcement becomes weaker. That would make savings the primary constraint.
   D. If participants lack overlapping social ties, reputational enforcement becomes weaker.


5. [Negative Factual] All of the following ROSCA variations are mentioned EXCEPT:
   A. lottery-based or negotiated payout order in this discussion.
   B. measuring pulse arrival times to detect gravitational waves.
   C. bidding for the pot by accepting a smaller payout.
   D. requiring guarantors for new members in this discussion.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author describe ROSCAs as relying on different “enforcement technologies”?
   A. To emphasize that social pressure and reputation can solely substitute for formal legal enforcement mechanisms. This would require groups to be the limiting factor.
   B. To emphasize that social pressure and reputation must substitute for formal legal enforcement mechanisms. This outcome would hold even if people stays constant.
   C. To emphasize that social pressure and reputation can substitute for formal legal enforcement others. That would make others the primary constraint.
   D. To emphasize that social pressure and reputation can substitute for formal legal enforcement mechanisms.


7. [Reference] In the passage, “this strength” refers to:
   A. the visibility of contributions and reputational pressure created by regular meetings. This outcome would hold even if groups stays constant.
   B. the visibility of contributions and reputational pressure created by regular meetings.
   C. the visibility of savings and reputational pressure created by regular meetings. This would require interest-free to be the limiting factor.
   D. the visibility of contributions and reputational pressure created by regular meetings. This outcome would hold even if interest-free stays constant.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces the problem of limited bank access, explains the basic ROSCA mechanism, discusses enforcement through social ties, surveys variations and psychological benefits, and ends with risks and broader implications. This would occur only when reputation dominates.
   B. It introduces the problem of limited bank access, explains the basic ROSCA mechanism, discusses enforcement through social ties, surveys variations and psychological benefits, and ends with participants and broader implications. This would occur only when communities dominates.
   C. It introduces the problem of limited bank access, explains the basic ROSCA mechanism, discusses enforcement through social ties, surveys variations and psychological benefits, and ends with risks and broader implications. That would make communities the primary constraint.
   D. It introduces the problem of limited bank access, explains the basic ROSCA mechanism, discusses enforcement through social ties, surveys variations and psychological benefits, and ends with risks and broader implications.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that a ROSCA can act as both saving and credit?
   A. Receiving the pot early functions like borrowing repaid later, whereas receiving late resembles accumulating savings before a payout. This would occur only when participants dominates.
   B. Receiving the pot early functions like borrowing repaid later, whereas receiving late resembles accumulating savings before a payout.
   C. Receiving the pot early functions like borrowing repaid earlier, whereas receiving late resembles accumulating savings before a payout. This outcome would hold even if groups stays constant.
   D. Receiving the pot early functions like borrowing repaid later, whereas receiving late resembles accumulating insurance before a payout. This would occur only when enforcement dominates.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage explains ROSCAs as community-based rotating funds in which members contribute regularly and take turns receiving a lump sum, showing how visibility and risks enforce payments, how different payout rules adapt the mechanism to needs, and how ROSCAs provide commitment and credit while remaining vulnerable to default and shared economic shocks. That would make others the primary constraint.
   B. The passage explains ROSCAs as community-based rotating funds in which members contribute regularly and take turns receiving a lump sum, showing how visibility and reputation enforce payments, how different payout rules adapt the mechanism to needs, and how ROSCAs provide commitment and credit while remaining vulnerable to default and shared economic shocks. This would occur only when people dominates.
