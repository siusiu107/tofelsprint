Passage 0075: Rotating Savings Groups and Social Enforcement
============================================================
(Word count: 611)

In many places, access to formal banking is less a matter of desire than of eligibility. A
family may have irregular income, no collateral, and no credit history that a distant
institution recognizes. Yet the need to smooth consumption, pay school fees, buy inventory,
or handle emergencies remains. In response, communities have developed financial
arrangements that rely not on contracts enforced by courts but on relationships enforced by
reputation. One of the most widespread is the rotating savings and credit association, often
abbreviated as ROSCA.

A ROSCA is simple in form. A group of participants agrees to contribute a fixed amount at
regular intervals—weekly, monthly, or aligned with harvest cycles. At each meeting, the
pooled sum is given to one member, and over time each participant receives the pot once. The
sequence can be determined by lottery, by bidding, or by negotiation based on need. A member
who receives the pot early is effectively receiving an interest-free loan repaid through
later contributions; a member who receives late is effectively saving, depositing
contributions until the payout. [A] The same mechanism, therefore, can function as credit
and as saving, depending on timing.

The advantage is not that ROSCAs are mathematically sophisticated; it is that they solve
practical frictions. Because members meet regularly, contributions are observable. Social
pressure substitutes for late fees. If someone fails to pay, the default is public, and the
cost is reputational, which can be more painful than a small penalty. In communities where
people trade, work, and marry within overlapping networks, reputation is not abstract; it
affects future cooperation. This is why ROSCAs can operate with minimal paperwork. Yet this
strength is also a vulnerability. If social ties weaken—because of migration, conflict, or
anonymity in large cities—enforcement can fail.

Variation reveals what ROSCAs are designed to handle. Some groups allow members to borrow
from one another between meetings, effectively creating a small credit market. Others
require a guarantor for new members or begin with small contributions until trust is
established. In bidding ROSCAs, members bid for the pot by offering to accept a smaller
payout; the “discount” can be distributed among others, creating an implicit return for
those who wait. Such designs mimic interest without invoking a bank’s infrastructure. [B]
They also reveal that the line between “informal” and “formal” finance is not a line between
chaos and order, but a line between different enforcement technologies.

ROSCAs also produce psychological benefits. Saving in a jar can be undone by temptation, but
saving in a group creates a commitment device. The regular meeting becomes a ritual that
turns an abstract plan into a repeated action. Moreover, receiving a lump sum at a
predictable time can enable purchases that would be difficult through incremental saving,
such as a sewing machine or a small refrigerator. In that sense, a ROSCA is not merely an
account; it is a schedule of possibilities.

Risks remain. If a member receives the pot early and then disappears, later participants
bear the loss. To reduce this risk, some ROSCAs give early payouts only to highly trusted
members, or they maintain an emergency fund. External shocks can also break the system: a
drought that reduces income for everyone at once makes contributions harder precisely when
needs increase. For that reason, ROSCAs rarely replace formal insurance; they complement it
where insurance is absent.

The persistence of ROSCAs suggests a general principle about finance. [C] People need
mechanisms that transform uncertain cash flows into dependable obligations, and when
institutions do not provide those mechanisms, communities build them. [D]

When meetings are missed, the group may publicly record the absence, turning reputation into
a practical accounting tool.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: A member who receives the pot early is effectively receiving an interest-free loan repaid through later contributions; a member who receives late is effectively saving, depositing contributions until the payout.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across members
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to contributions and saving
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of members

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents saving as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once contributions is observed, competing explanations for roscas collapse. It treats members as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   B. The passage surveys roscas but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed saving first, with contributions serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats members as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   C. The passage concedes that contributions is often incomplete and concludes that roscas cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since members overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of saving with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, especially regarding member.
   D. The passage explains roscas by linking contributions to saving, and it shows why members changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage treats contributions primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over saving are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about roscas are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in members, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of contributions is enough to validate saving for roscas.
   C. The passage implies that members mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes contributions effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of saving no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain roscas, for the main claim of the text, given the evidence cited.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how roscas should change if members is altered, instead of assuming that contributions has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to saving must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of saving as a factor influencing contributions, as the discussion implies.
   B. discussion of members as a factor influencing contributions
   C. discussion of roscas as a factor influencing contributions
   D. discussion of allometric scaling as a factor influencing contributions

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: A member who receives the pot early is effectively receiving an interest-free loan repaid through later contributions; a member who receives late is effectively saving, depositing contributions until the payout.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding members, especially regarding credit.
   B. A member who receives the pot early is effectively receiving an interest-free loan repaid through later contributions. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, as framed by the author.
   D. A member who receives the pot early is effectively receiving an interest-free loan repaid through later contributions. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of saving guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in members are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because once contributions fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and members can be ignored without changing conclusions about roscas.
   C. Because contributions directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding roscas.
   D. Because comparability prevents saving from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold members constant while examining contributions.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | contributions | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | members | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It proves saving is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that roscas should be read alongside members, because contributions alone does not settle what saving means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This is why ROSCAs can operate with minimal paperwork.
   A. the idea that If someone fails to pay, the default is public, and the cost is reputational, which can be more painful than a small penalty...
   B. the idea that Yet this strength is also a vulnerability, in the setting discussed, under the stated assumptions.
   C. the idea that In communities where people trade, work, and marry within overlapping networks, reputation is not abstract; it affects future cooperation
   D. the idea that One of the most widespread is the rotating savings and credit association, often abbreviated as ROSCA
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of contributions and saving should be abandoned altogether.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of contributions lead to different conclusions about roscas.
   C. to show that the term roscas belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding members.
   D. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses saving, so debate over contributions is unnecessary noise, in the examples provided.
