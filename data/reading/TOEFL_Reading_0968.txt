Passage 0968: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 758)

Across different subduction segments, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as the decisive sign of
subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip. Granted that seafloor pressure sensors
can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is
conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about
data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Seldom, prior to the
field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify fluid overpressure in faults, did
investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which seafloor pressure sensors constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even if a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Rarely has it been the case that
claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions, at least before analysts began
combining seafloor pressure sensors with cross-site comparisons. [A] The author notes that
generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. The passage argues that the
goal was to break degeneracies in which tsunami-generating seafloor uplift could be
explained in more than one way because confounders like fluid overpressure in faults often
co-vary with the driver. [B] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. [C] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead to a
different conclusion. [D] The argument hinges on what would change under an alternative
explanation. Never before analysts began combining seafloor pressure sensors with cross-site
comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about subduction-zone megathrust
earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which tsunami-generating
seafloor uplift could be explained in more than one way because, as the author notes,
confounders like fluid overpressure in faults often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
which changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. If anything is responsible, it
is methodological humility, and therefore the passage presents as the lesson of subduction-
zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is constrained by what competing models
would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the
same observation—tsunami-generating seafloor uplift—must be paired with tests that change
the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat tsunami-generating
seafloor uplift as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point
for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret without
assumptions. In this sense, episodic tremor and slip is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike the Cascadia
subduction zone. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying
mechanisms differed because fluid overpressure in faults shifted the baseline in different
directions across sites, which is why replication matters. Not treating tsunami-generating
seafloor uplift as a self-sufficient conclusion, but the author therefore separates
detection from interpretation. Rarely has it been the case that the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical, at least before the field adopted
tests that manipulate or stratify fluid overpressure in faults. by comparing cases in which
seafloor pressure sensors constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, slow-slip events on plate interfaces is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, researchers found that the
passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces
competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if inversion of seismic waveforms produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. Because locked versus creeping patches co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. it prevents tsunami-generating seafloor uplift from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control locked versus creeping patches

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. inversion of seismic waveforms
   B. the length of the Nile in miles
   C. foreshock clustering
   D. Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. The discussion suggests that stress transfer after large events is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The passage implies that the Cascadia subduction zone is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'slow-slip events on plate interfaces' refers to a different field altogether, not to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where numerical rupture simulations constrains stress transfer after large events

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Rarely has it been the case that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions, at least before analysts began combining seafloor pressure sensors with cross-site comparisons.
   A. foreshock clustering specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. inversion of seismic waveforms as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. fluid overpressure in faults alone, treated as the sole cause

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats the Chilean margin as a special case and argues that no broader inference about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip is possible.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away locked versus creeping patches, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when locked versus creeping patches can mimic low-frequency tremor bursts.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using numerical rupture simulations.

   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Can be contaminated by background variability
   B. Changes the apparent slope

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: Rarely has it been the case that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions, at least before analysts began combining seafloor pressure sensors with cross-site comparisons.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because tsunami-generating seafloor uplift uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Japan Trench region and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on numerical rupture simulations simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates fluid overpressure in faults.

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like fluid overpressure in faults make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting seafloor pressure sensors as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because tsunami-generating seafloor uplift uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that fluid overpressure in faults is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using seafloor pressure sensors are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats seafloor pressure sensors as a historical curiosity and does not discuss tsunami-generating seafloor uplift or fluid overpressure in faults. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how fluid overpressure in faults can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Chilean margin. Finally, it maintains that tests combining seafloor pressure sensors with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.

   B. complete and final, so no further checks like seafloor pressure sensors are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because heterogeneous frictional properties dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip, serving only as background detail
