Passage 0475: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 791)

Despite local variability, the passage argues that researchers have treated reduced
photosynthetic efficiency as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves. Admittedly, degree-heating-week metrics can make the pattern look unusually
sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using degree-heating-week metrics under stable conditions, the argument reframes the issue
so that one frequently cited case from Red Sea reefs appeared to support the direct-readout
view. Although the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed
that small shifts in local adaptation altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic reduced
photosynthetic efficiency. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which is precisely
why illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. In this sense, thermal bleaching events is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on local adaptation, the author treats the
complication as diagnostic, so many early studies framed coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves as a single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] The author notes that generalization
requires more than a single well-chosen case. Whereas those studies emphasized reduced
photosynthetic efficiency as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under
replication. [B] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. this
shift mattered for how evidence from Red Sea reefs was generalized largely because local
conditions can change which processes generate reduced photosynthetic efficiency. [C] Later
comparisons reveal why this matters. [D] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead
of treating them as afterthoughts.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify local adaptation, did
investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which degree-heating-week metrics constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can
be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

Using degree-heating-week metrics under stable conditions, the argument reframes the issue
so that one frequently cited case from Red Sea reefs appeared to support the direct-readout
view. the original fit looked visually decisive; still, later, however, reanalysis showed
that small shifts in local adaptation altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic reduced
photosynthetic efficiency. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, an outcome that
illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. In
this sense, loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Never before analysts began combining degree-heating-week metrics with cross-site
comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
the goal was to break degeneracies in which reduced photosynthetic efficiency could be
explained in more than one way because confounders like local adaptation often co-vary with
the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of coral bleaching
triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation is granted, then the same
observation—reduced photosynthetic efficiency—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat reduced photosynthetic
efficiency as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions.
In this sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about coral
bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even though
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which reduced photosynthetic efficiency is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | photophysiology measurements | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | mortality and phase shifts | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices
   B. Can mimic the target feature
   C. It makes disease outbreaks irrelevant.

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats Caribbean reef tracts as a special case and argues that no broader inference about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves is possible.
   B. The passage suggests that recruitment failure is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving satellite thermal stress maps.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when symbiont clade switching can mimic recruitment failure.

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once mortality and phase shifts is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Since mortality and phase shifts is observed in the Coral Triangle, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

   Sentence: by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because recruitment failure uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Red Sea reefs and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates compound stressors such as acidification and pollution.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on symbiont genotyping simple.

   A. The author argues that symbiont genotyping should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'heat-driven coral whitening' refers to a different field altogether, not to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves.
   C. The discussion suggests that local adaptation is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where symbiont genotyping constrains local adaptation

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because reduced photosynthetic efficiency uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that symbiont clade switching is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using degree-heating-week metrics are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like symbiont clade switching make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting degree-heating-week metrics as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that reduced photosynthetic efficiency is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how symbiont clade switching can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Caribbean reef tracts. Finally, it maintains that tests combining degree-heating-week metrics with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats degree-heating-week metrics as a historical curiosity and does not discuss reduced photosynthetic efficiency or symbiont clade switching. It ends without any methodological implication.
