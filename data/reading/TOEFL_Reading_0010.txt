Passage 0010: Upwelling Timing and Cycles in Small Pelagic Fisheries (Oceanography)
===================================================================================
(Word count: 613)

Along certain coasts, cold water rises from the deep and turns the sea into a moving pantry.
This process, coastal upwelling, occurs when winds push surface water away from shore and
deeper water replaces it. Because deep water is often rich in dissolved nutrients, upwelling
can trigger blooms of phytoplankton, which support zooplankton, fish, and seabirds. It can
therefore be tempting to treat upwelling as a simple blessing: more nutrients, more food,
more fish. Yet the link between upwelling and fish abundance is not a straight line. It
depends on timing, intensity, and the life cycles of the organisms that must ride the
pulses.

Upwelling is driven by winds that are seasonal and variable. If winds are moderate and
persistent during the spawning season of small pelagic fish such as sardines or anchovies,
the resulting plankton can provide reliable food for larvae. But if winds are too strong,
surface waters can become turbulent, dispersing larvae and pushing them offshore into
habitats with fewer predators in some cases but poorer feeding in others. If winds begin
late, larvae may hatch into a water column that has not yet been fertilized, and early
starvation can occur even though nutrients arrive later.

These subtleties help explain why fisheries can oscillate between anchovy‑dominated and
sardine‑dominated regimes. One account emphasizes physical forcing: shifts in wind patterns
and ocean temperature favor one species’ spawning strategy over the other’s. A second
account emphasizes biological feedback: once one species becomes abundant, it can consume
the plankton community in a way that disadvantages the other, and predation on eggs and
larvae can amplify that dominance. [A] Under the physical account, a change in wind and
temperature should precede a regime shift. [B] Under the feedback account, dominance could
persist even after physical conditions become less favorable, because the dominant species
reshapes the food web. [C]

Long-term records from some eastern boundary currents suggest that both forces operate, but
not always on the same schedule. In one multidecadal series, anchovy recruitment rose
following years with earlier, moderate upwelling, while sardine recruitment rose following
years with warmer surface temperatures and later upwelling. Yet there were also periods when
sardines remained abundant despite a return to conditions that had previously favored
anchovies. Those periods are difficult to interpret if one assumes that winds alone dictate
the outcome; they make more sense if one allows that a dominant population can modify prey
fields and predation pressure, creating inertia in the system.

The consequences of these cycles extend beyond fishers. Seabirds breeding on islands can
fail in years when prey fish are scarce near shore, even if fish are present farther
offshore. Marine mammals can shift foraging ranges, and coastal communities that depend on
one fishery can face economic shocks when the regime flips. [D] Thus, upwelling is not
merely a physical event; it is an ecological driver whose effects are mediated by life
history and by competition.

To predict future regimes, researchers increasingly track not only wind indices but also
larval survival conditions: the match between plankton timing and hatching, the degree of
turbulence, and the nearshore retention of young fish. The core lesson remains simple,
though its consequences are complex: deep water brings nutrients, but nutrients help fish
only when the ocean’s timing aligns with the fragile early stages of life.

Upwelling can also carry chemical consequences. Deep water is often low in oxygen and high
in dissolved carbon dioxide, so intense upwelling can bring hypoxic, more acidic water onto
the shelf, stressing shellfish and benthic organisms. A coast can therefore experience a
paradoxical season in which nutrients rise and plankton blooms expand while some nearshore
habitats suffer from low oxygen.


Questions
---------

1. [Inference] What can be inferred from the passage about why stronger upwelling is not always better for fish recruitment?
   A. Very strong winds can increase turbulence and transport larvae offshore, which may reduce feeding or survival
   B. Strong winds prevent nutrients from reaching the surface entirely
   C. Larvae survive best when the ocean is always turbulent
   D. Upwelling affects only seabirds, not fish

2. [Vocabulary] The word “inertia” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a tendency to persist or resist change
   B. a sudden collapse
   C. a nutrient source
   D. a fishing technique

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author contrast a “physical forcing” account with a “biological feedback” account?
   A. To show that regime shifts can be driven by both environmental changes and population interactions, which make different predictions about timing
   B. To argue that winds never influence upwelling
   C. To claim that competition is irrelevant in the ocean
   D. To suggest that sardines and anchovies are identical species

4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In that case, the abundance of one species becomes part of the environment experienced by the other.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as reasons recruitment can fail EXCEPT:
   A. late onset of nutrient-rich conditions during hatching
   B. excess turbulence dispersing larvae
   C. mismatch between plankton timing and spawning
   D. the formation of basalt columns in the ocean floor

6. [Factual] According to the passage, what initiates coastal upwelling?
   A. Winds push surface water away from shore, allowing deeper water to rise and replace it
   B. Deep water rises because it is lighter than surface water
   C. Fish schools migrate upward and carry nutrients with them
   D. Tides always pull deep water toward the surface at midday

7. [Reference] In the sentence “Those periods are difficult to interpret…,” the phrase “Those periods” refers to times when:
   A. anchovies and sardines were both absent from the ocean
   B. sardines remained abundant even after conditions returned that had favored anchovies before
   C. winds stopped entirely for several years
   D. seabirds moved offshore permanently

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces upwelling, explains why timing and intensity matter, compares two accounts for regime shifts, and then describes ecological and human consequences
   B. It lists chemical elements found in seawater without discussing winds
   C. It narrates a single fishing trip without broader explanation
   D. It focuses only on seabirds and ignores ocean physics

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that nutrients help fish only when timing aligns with early life stages?
   A. Productive conditions must coincide with hatching and larval survival; otherwise the added nutrients arrive too late to prevent early losses
   B. Nutrients always increase recruitment regardless of season
   C. Larvae do not depend on plankton for food
   D. Upwelling determines adult fish size but not survival

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Upwelling always increases fish populations because nutrients guarantee recruitment.
   B. The passage explains that coastal upwelling brings nutrients but that fish abundance depends on wind timing and intensity; regime shifts between sardines and anchovies can reflect both physical conditions and biological feedbacks, with consequences for ecosystems and coastal communities.
   C. Sardine and anchovy cycles are caused solely by island seabirds changing nests.
   D. Upwelling occurs when tides pull surface water offshore, and turbulence has no effect on larvae.
