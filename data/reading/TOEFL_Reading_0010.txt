Passage 0010: Upwelling Timing and Cycles in Small Pelagic Fisheries (Oceanography)
===================================================================================
(Word count: 613)

Along certain coasts, cold water rises from the deep and turns the sea into a moving pantry.
This process, coastal upwelling, occurs when winds push surface water away from shore and
deeper water replaces it. Because deep water is often rich in dissolved nutrients, upwelling
can trigger blooms of phytoplankton, which support zooplankton, fish, and seabirds. It can
therefore be tempting to treat upwelling as a simple blessing: more nutrients, more food,
more fish. Yet the link between upwelling and fish abundance is not a straight line. It
depends on timing, intensity, and the life cycles of the organisms that must ride the
pulses.

Upwelling is driven by winds that are seasonal and variable. If winds are moderate and
persistent during the spawning season of small pelagic fish such as sardines or anchovies,
the resulting plankton can provide reliable food for larvae. But if winds are too strong,
surface waters can become turbulent, dispersing larvae and pushing them offshore into
habitats with fewer predators in some cases but poorer feeding in others. If winds begin
late, larvae may hatch into a water column that has not yet been fertilized, and early
starvation can occur even though nutrients arrive later.

These subtleties help explain why fisheries can oscillate between anchovy‑dominated and
sardine‑dominated regimes. One account emphasizes physical forcing: shifts in wind patterns
and ocean temperature favor one species’ spawning strategy over the other’s. A second
account emphasizes biological feedback: once one species becomes abundant, it can consume
the plankton community in a way that disadvantages the other, and predation on eggs and
larvae can amplify that dominance. [A] Under the physical account, a change in wind and
temperature should precede a regime shift. [B] Under the feedback account, dominance could
persist even after physical conditions become less favorable, because the dominant species
reshapes the food web. [C]

Long-term records from some eastern boundary currents suggest that both forces operate, but
not always on the same schedule. In one multidecadal series, anchovy recruitment rose
following years with earlier, moderate upwelling, while sardine recruitment rose following
years with warmer surface temperatures and later upwelling. Yet there were also periods when
sardines remained abundant despite a return to conditions that had previously favored
anchovies. Those periods are difficult to interpret if one assumes that winds alone dictate
the outcome; they make more sense if one allows that a dominant population can modify prey
fields and predation pressure, creating inertia in the system.

The consequences of these cycles extend beyond fishers. Seabirds breeding on islands can
fail in years when prey fish are scarce near shore, even if fish are present farther
offshore. Marine mammals can shift foraging ranges, and coastal communities that depend on
one fishery can face economic shocks when the regime flips. [D] Thus, upwelling is not
merely a physical event; it is an ecological driver whose effects are mediated by life
history and by competition.

To predict future regimes, researchers increasingly track not only wind indices but also
larval survival conditions: the match between plankton timing and hatching, the degree of
turbulence, and the nearshore retention of young fish. The core lesson remains simple,
though its consequences are complex: deep water brings nutrients, but nutrients help fish
only when the ocean’s timing aligns with the fragile early stages of life.

Upwelling can also carry chemical consequences. Deep water is often low in oxygen and high
in dissolved carbon dioxide, so intense upwelling can bring hypoxic, more acidic water onto
the shelf, stressing shellfish and benthic organisms. A coast can therefore experience a
paradoxical season in which nutrients rise and plankton blooms expand while some nearshore
habitats suffer from low oxygen.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "amplify" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: A second account emphasizes biological feedback: once one species becomes abundant, it can consume the plankton community in a way that disadvantages the other, and predation on eggs and larvae can amplify that dominance.
   A. make larger or more intense, as used to describe how the claim holds across nutrients
   B. close the question permanently, which would rule out further evaluation of nutrients
   C. weaken substantially, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. treat as irrelevant, despite references to water and winds, in the context of the passage.

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains upwelling by linking water to winds, and it shows why nutrients changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage concedes that water is often incomplete and concludes that upwelling cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since nutrients overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of winds with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage presents winds as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once water is observed, competing explanations for upwelling collapse. It treats nutrients as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding larvae.
   D. The passage surveys upwelling but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed winds first, with water serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats nutrients as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how upwelling should change if nutrients is altered, instead of assuming that water has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to winds must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in nutrients, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of water is enough to validate winds for upwelling, especially regarding nutrients, within the passage’s scope.
   C. The passage treats water primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over winds are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about upwelling are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. The passage implies that nutrients mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes water effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of winds no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain upwelling, in the context of the passage.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of nutrients as a factor influencing water, especially regarding upwelling.
   B. discussion of upwelling as a factor influencing water
   C. discussion of winds as a factor influencing water
   D. discussion of contact-zone multilingualism as a factor influencing water

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Those periods are difficult to interpret if one assumes that winds alone dictate the outcome; they make more sense if one allows that a dominant population can modify prey fields and predation pressure, creating inertia in the system.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   B. Those periods are difficult to interpret if one assumes that winds alone dictate the outcome. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. Those periods are difficult to interpret if one assumes that winds alone dictate the outcome. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding plankton, in the context of the passage.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once water fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and nutrients can be ignored without changing conclusions about upwelling.
   B. Because the presence of winds guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in nutrients are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because water directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding upwelling.
   D. Because comparability prevents winds from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold nutrients constant while examining water.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | water | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | nutrients | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It proves winds is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that upwelling should be read alongside nutrients, because water alone does not settle what winds means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This process, coastal upwelling, occurs when winds push surface water away from shore and deeper water replaces it.
   A. the preceding claim that upwelling functions as a direct measurement of winds
   B. the preceding claim that nutrients alone explains the outcome of upwelling
   C. the preceding claim that water is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   D. the preceding claim about how water is interpreted in relation to winds

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses winds, so debate over water is unnecessary noise, especially regarding upwelling.
   B. to show that the term upwelling belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding water.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of water lead to different conclusions about upwelling.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of water and winds should be abandoned altogether.
