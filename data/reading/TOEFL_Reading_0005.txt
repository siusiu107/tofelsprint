Passage 0005: Expectations, Contracts, and the Making of Inflation Spirals (Economics)
======================================================================================
(Word count: 606)

Inflation is often introduced as a simple rise in prices, but the more important question is
why prices rise in a way that becomes self-sustaining. A shopkeeper who raises prices once
because shipping costs spike is not necessarily participating in an inflationary spiral. A
spiral emerges when expectations reshape behavior: workers demand higher wages because they
anticipate higher living costs; firms raise prices because they anticipate higher wage
bills; and both sides treat those anticipations as prudent, not speculative. In other words,
the future becomes an input to the present.

Expectations matter because many prices are not set continuously. Wages are negotiated
periodically, rents are fixed in contracts, and even restaurant menus are updated in
batches. When economic agents suspect that costs will rise before the next renegotiation,
they try to preempt the loss. Workers seek cost‑of‑living adjustments, firms build in a
cushion, and landlords prefer shorter leases. These choices can be individually reasonable
while collectively pushing the price level upward.

Yet expectations do not float free. They are anchored—or unanchored—by experiences and
signals. In a period where prices have been stable for decades, a temporary shock may be
treated as noise. By contrast, in a period where households have watched groceries and
energy prices climb month after month, the same temporary shock can be read as confirmation
that “things are getting worse,” altering bargaining behavior. [A] Surveys of households
frequently show this asymmetry: recent price increases in salient goods weigh more heavily
than abstract assurances about long-run stability. [B] The mechanism is cognitive as much as
economic, because people infer the future from what they encounter most often. [C]

Firms, for their part, respond not only to costs but also to the risk of being the last to
adjust. If a firm delays a price increase while competitors move first, it can be squeezed:
costs rise while revenue lags. When many firms share that fear, they update prices earlier
and more frequently, which itself makes price changes more visible to consumers, feeding
expectation shifts. That feedback is especially strong in sectors where prices are posted
and compared publicly, such as fuel stations, because consumers can watch adjustments in
real time and interpret them as signals of a broader trend.

However, inflation expectations can also soften. If wage growth slows, if energy prices
retreat, and if firms begin to believe that consumers will resist further increases, then
the incentive to “preload” prices diminishes. In such cases, contracts are renewed with
smaller adjustments, and the pace of price updating decelerates. [D] The key point is that
inflation is not merely a list of higher numbers; it is a pattern of decisions made under
uncertainty, shaped by what people believe will happen before the next contract, menu
update, or pay negotiation.

Understanding inflation therefore requires tracking the causal bridge between experience and
expectation. When salient prices rise repeatedly, expectations harden; when expectations
harden, bargaining and pricing strategies shift; when strategies shift, price changes become
more frequent and visible. The spiral is not inevitable, but it is intelligible: it is
produced by ordinary actors trying to protect themselves against anticipated loss.

Contracts can amplify these dynamics through indexation. When leases, supply agreements, or
wage deals are written to adjust automatically with a price index, today’s increases
mechanically become tomorrow’s increases, reducing the need to renegotiate but also reducing
the system’s ability to cool quickly. Retailers may also respond by changing package size
rather than sticker price, but consumers who notice “shrinkage” can interpret it as another
sign that inflation is entrenched, which can harden expectations even when official prices
move more slowly.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "salient" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [A] Surveys of households frequently show this asymmetry: recent price increases in salient goods weigh more heavily than abstract assurances about long-run stability.
   A. fully resolved and closed to debate, which would rule out further evaluation of inflation
   B. subtle and easy to miss, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. peripheral to the author’s point, despite references to price and expectations
   D. most noticeable or important, as used to describe how the claim holds across inflation

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents expectations as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once price is observed, competing explanations for prices collapse. It treats inflation as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   B. The passage surveys prices but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed expectations first, with price serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats inflation as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, especially regarding costs.
   C. The passage explains prices by linking price to expectations, and it shows why inflation changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage concedes that price is often incomplete and concludes that prices cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since inflation overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of expectations with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that inflation mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes price effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of expectations no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain prices, given the evidence cited.
   B. A persuasive account would predict how prices should change if inflation is altered, instead of assuming that price has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to expectations must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   C. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in inflation, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of price is enough to validate expectations for prices, especially regarding price, especially regarding inflation.
   D. The passage treats price primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over expectations are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about prices are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of prices as a factor influencing price
   B. discussion of sediment provenance as a factor influencing price
   C. discussion of inflation as a factor influencing price, especially regarding firms.
   D. discussion of expectations as a factor influencing price

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] The key point is that inflation is not merely a list of higher numbers; it is a pattern of decisions made under uncertainty, shaped by what people believe will happen before the next contract, menu update, or pay negotiation.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   B. [D] The key point is that inflation is not merely a list of higher numbers. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. [D] The key point is that inflation is not merely a list of higher numbers. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, in the context of the passage.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents expectations from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold inflation constant while examining price.
   B. Because the presence of expectations guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in inflation are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because price directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding prices.
   D. Because once price fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and inflation can be ignored without changing conclusions about prices.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | price | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | inflation | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It proves expectations is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that prices should be read alongside inflation, because price alone does not settle what expectations means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: These choices can be individually reasonable while collectively pushing the price level upward.
   A. the preceding claim that price is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   B. the preceding claim that inflation alone explains the outcome of prices
   C. the preceding claim that prices functions as a direct measurement of expectations
   D. the preceding claim about how price is interpreted in relation to expectations

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term prices belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding price.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses expectations, so debate over price is unnecessary noise, in the cases described.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of price lead to different conclusions about prices.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of price and expectations should be abandoned altogether.
