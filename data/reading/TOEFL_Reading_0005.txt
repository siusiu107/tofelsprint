Passage 0005: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 798)

In hazard assessments, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: researchers
have treated low-frequency tremor bursts as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust
earthquakes and slow slip. inversion of seismic waveforms can make the pattern look
unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Rarely, unless the field adopted tests
that manipulate or stratify locked versus creeping patches, does one see why the debate
became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which
inversion of seismic waveforms constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. Only after analysts began combining inversion of
seismic waveforms with cross-site comparisons did claims about subduction-zone megathrust
earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which low-frequency tremor
bursts could be explained in more than one way because confounders like locked versus
creeping patches often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. What matters most is methodological
humility, which is why the passage presents as the lesson of subduction-zone megathrust
earthquakes and slow slip: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation is granted, then the same
observation—low-frequency tremor bursts—must be paired with tests that change the conditions
under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat low-frequency tremor bursts as an
endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental
or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. Only after analysts
began combining inversion of seismic waveforms with cross-site comparisons did the earlier
interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes
and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which low-
frequency tremor bursts could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
locked versus creeping patches often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in
turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, episodic tremor
and slip is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In
replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols
were applied in settings unlike the Chilean margin. [A] The passage frames uncertainty as an
ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment. the same summary statistic could be
reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely because locked versus creeping
patches shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. [B] The author treats
this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation, not because treating low-frequency tremor bursts as a self-sufficient
conclusion, but because the assumptions differ. [C] This is presented not as a loophole, but
as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. [D] This reasoning matters because it changes
what counts as a decisive test. Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or
stratify locked versus creeping patches could one reasonably claim that the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which inversion
of seismic waveforms constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does
not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
In this sense, slow-slip events on plate interfaces is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, the passage concludes that the most
informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.
by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces
analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without
implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Chilean margin and everywhere else.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates fluid overpressure in faults.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on numerical rupture simulations simple.

2. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. Since transient surface deformation is observed in the Cascadia subduction zone, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. Because transient surface deformation appears, the mechanism must be unique, so stress transfer after large events can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once transient surface deformation is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. it prevents transient surface deformation from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control stress transfer after large events

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that low-frequency tremor bursts is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how fluid overpressure in faults can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Cascadia subduction zone. Finally, it maintains that tests combining numerical rupture simulations with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats numerical rupture simulations as a historical curiosity and does not discuss low-frequency tremor bursts or fluid overpressure in faults. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that fluid overpressure in faults is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using numerical rupture simulations are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like fluid overpressure in faults make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting numerical rupture simulations as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing theories?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where numerical rupture simulations constrains locked versus creeping patches
   B. The author argues that numerical rupture simulations should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage implies that the Chilean margin is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The discussion suggests that locked versus creeping patches is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
