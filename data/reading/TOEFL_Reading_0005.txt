Passage 0005: Expectations, Contracts, and the Making of Inflation Spirals (Economics)
======================================================================================
(Word count: 606)

Inflation is often introduced as a simple rise in prices, but the more important question is
why prices rise in a way that becomes self-sustaining. A shopkeeper who raises prices once
because shipping costs spike is not necessarily participating in an inflationary spiral. A
spiral emerges when expectations reshape behavior: workers demand higher wages because they
anticipate higher living costs; firms raise prices because they anticipate higher wage
bills; and both sides treat those anticipations as prudent, not speculative. In other words,
the future becomes an input to the present.

Expectations matter because many prices are not set continuously. Wages are negotiated
periodically, rents are fixed in contracts, and even restaurant menus are updated in
batches. When economic agents suspect that costs will rise before the next renegotiation,
they try to preempt the loss. Workers seek cost‑of‑living adjustments, firms build in a
cushion, and landlords prefer shorter leases. These choices can be individually reasonable
while collectively pushing the price level upward.

Yet expectations do not float free. They are anchored—or unanchored—by experiences and
signals. In a period where prices have been stable for decades, a temporary shock may be
treated as noise. By contrast, in a period where households have watched groceries and
energy prices climb month after month, the same temporary shock can be read as confirmation
that “things are getting worse,” altering bargaining behavior. [A] Surveys of households
frequently show this asymmetry: recent price increases in salient goods weigh more heavily
than abstract assurances about long-run stability. [B] The mechanism is cognitive as much as
economic, because people infer the future from what they encounter most often. [C]

Firms, for their part, respond not only to costs but also to the risk of being the last to
adjust. If a firm delays a price increase while competitors move first, it can be squeezed:
costs rise while revenue lags. When many firms share that fear, they update prices earlier
and more frequently, which itself makes price changes more visible to consumers, feeding
expectation shifts. That feedback is especially strong in sectors where prices are posted
and compared publicly, such as fuel stations, because consumers can watch adjustments in
real time and interpret them as signals of a broader trend.

However, inflation expectations can also soften. If wage growth slows, if energy prices
retreat, and if firms begin to believe that consumers will resist further increases, then
the incentive to “preload” prices diminishes. In such cases, contracts are renewed with
smaller adjustments, and the pace of price updating decelerates. [D] The key point is that
inflation is not merely a list of higher numbers; it is a pattern of decisions made under
uncertainty, shaped by what people believe will happen before the next contract, menu
update, or pay negotiation.

Understanding inflation therefore requires tracking the causal bridge between experience and
expectation. When salient prices rise repeatedly, expectations harden; when expectations
harden, bargaining and pricing strategies shift; when strategies shift, price changes become
more frequent and visible. The spiral is not inevitable, but it is intelligible: it is
produced by ordinary actors trying to protect themselves against anticipated loss.

Contracts can amplify these dynamics through indexation. When leases, supply agreements, or
wage deals are written to adjust automatically with a price index, today’s increases
mechanically become tomorrow’s increases, reducing the need to renegotiate but also reducing
the system’s ability to cool quickly. Retailers may also respond by changing package size
rather than sticker price, but consumers who notice “shrinkage” can interpret it as another
sign that inflation is entrenched, which can harden expectations even when official prices
move more slowly.

   B. To argue that inflation has nothing to do with wages or contracts
   C. To claim that menus determine all macroeconomic outcomes
   D. To suggest that prices never change in stable economies

3. [Negative Factual] All of the following are cited as reasons expectations can become stronger EXCEPT:
   A. repeated increases in salient goods like groceries and energy
   B. publicly visible posted prices such as fuel
   C. fear of being the last firm to adjust prices
   D. the presence of a single unobserved shock that households never notice

4. [Inference] What can be inferred from the passage about a sector with highly visible posted prices?
   A. Frequent visible adjustments may reinforce consumer beliefs that broader inflation is underway
   B. Posted prices prevent firms from changing prices at all
   C. Consumers in such sectors are less likely to form expectations about the future
   D. Visibility eliminates competition among firms

5. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: As a result, a household’s daily shopping basket can shape its sense of the economy more than official reports do.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

6. [Factual] According to the passage, what helps turn a one-time cost shock into a spiral?
   A. Expectations that lead workers and firms to adjust wages and prices in advance of future costs
   B. A permanent ban on contracts
   C. A decline in menu prices
   D. An increase in the number of competitors, regardless of costs

7. [Reference] In the sentence “they update prices earlier and more frequently,” the word “they” refers to:
   A. consumers watching fuel prices
   B. firms responding to the risk of delayed adjustment
   C. contracts that fix rents
   D. surveys that measure household beliefs

8. [Organization] How does the author develop the explanation of inflation?
   A. By moving from a definition to the role of expectations, then to how experiences shape beliefs, and finally to how behavior can also reverse
   B. By listing inflation rates by country without explaining mechanisms
   C. By describing only government budgets
   D. By focusing solely on shipping costs

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that “the future becomes an input to the present”?
   A. People act today based on what they believe costs and prices will be before the next negotiation
   B. Only past prices matter for current decisions
   C. Contracts eliminate uncertainty about future costs
   D. Inflation is determined only by currency design

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Inflation is simply higher prices caused by shipping costs, and expectations play no role.
   B. The passage argues that inflation can become self-sustaining when experiences shape expectations, expectations shape wage and pricing decisions, and visible price adjustments reinforce beliefs, though the pattern can soften when incentives and beliefs change.
   C. Inflation occurs only in sectors with hidden prices and cannot be seen by consumers.
   D. Price stability requires that all wages be renegotiated daily.
