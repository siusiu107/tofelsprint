Passage 0429: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 649)

In replication attempts, the passage argues that researchers have treated school-quality
gradients as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Granted that mobility tracking with administrative records can make
the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move
from description to explanation, then the same observation—school-quality gradients—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat school-quality gradients as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is
scientifically revealing. In this sense, spatial stratification in cities is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] This point forces
the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline. Were one wishes to move from
description to explanation to fail, then the same observation—school-quality gradients—must
be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] At first glance,
the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. Whereas popular
summaries treat school-quality gradients as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats
it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes more
predictive under replication. [C] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are
tested. [D] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is
inferred.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from
historical redlining, does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which mobility tracking with administrative records
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an
outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense,
segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike large U.S. metropolitan areas. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because path
dependence from historical redlining shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. The issue is not treating school-quality gradients as a self-sufficient conclusion;
it is that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense,
persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about residential
segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. To be sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong,
yet the result is a framework in which school-quality gradients is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | spatial autocorrelation analysis | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | disparate exposure to pollution | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | informational asymmetries in housing search | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Can mimic the target feature
   B. It proves school-quality gradients is unique.
   C. Can vary across epochs
   D. Depends on modeling priors

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The author argues that audit studies in housing markets should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'spatial stratification in cities' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   C. The discussion suggests that path dependence from historical redlining is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where audit studies in housing markets constrains path dependence from historical redlining

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the author’s favorite color
   B. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   C. school-quality gradients
   D. mobility tracking with administrative records

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **subtle** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because zoning rules and land-use regulation dominates all evidence
   B. slight
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like spatial autocorrelation analysis are needed
   D. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates zoning rules and land-use regulation.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in rapidly growing Sun Belt regions and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because wealth accumulation gaps uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on longitudinal panel data simple.

6. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving audit studies in housing markets.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using audit studies in housing markets.
   C. The author treats large U.S. metropolitan areas as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when credit market discrimination can mimic mobility constraints across space.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This point matters because the simplest interpretation often survives only by silently restricting the range of cases under discussion.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that disparate exposure to pollution is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how path dependence from historical redlining can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from post-industrial cities. Finally, it maintains that tests combining quasi-experimental policy evaluation with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats quasi-experimental policy evaluation as a historical curiosity and does not discuss disparate exposure to pollution or path dependence from historical redlining. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because disparate exposure to pollution uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that path dependence from historical redlining is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using quasi-experimental policy evaluation are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting quasi-experimental policy evaluation as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

9. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. Because wealth accumulation gaps appears, the mechanism must be unique, so credit market discrimination can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if longitudinal panel data produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. Because credit market discrimination co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. it prevents wealth accumulation gaps from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control credit market discrimination

10. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. wealth accumulation gaps specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. informational asymmetries in housing search alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. longitudinal panel data as a device rather than as an analytic approach
