Passage 0748: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 744)

Despite local variability, one sees why researchers have treated reduced photosynthetic
efficiency as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves. While it
is true that degree-heating-week metrics can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify compound stressors such as
acidification and pollution was it clear that the debate became empirically productive
rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which degree-heating-week metrics
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample,
something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, thermal
bleaching events is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation
is granted, then the same observation—reduced photosynthetic efficiency—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
reduced photosynthetic efficiency as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another.

Only after analysts began combining degree-heating-week metrics with cross-site comparisons
did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about coral bleaching
triggered by marine heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which reduced photosynthetic
efficiency could be explained in more than one way because confounders like compound
stressors such as acidification and pollution often co-vary with the driver, which is why
replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable. In this sense, loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike Caribbean reef tracts. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because compound
stressors such as acidification and pollution shifted the baseline in different directions
across sites, which is why replication matters. the author therefore separates detection
from interpretation—not treating reduced photosynthetic efficiency as a self-sufficient
conclusion.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify compound stressors such as
acidification and pollution was it defensible to argue that the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] This detail becomes important later, when
assumptions are tested. by comparing cases in which degree-heating-week metrics constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps
explain why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B]
The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out.
While it is true that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] Later comparisons
reveal why this matters. [D] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author
frames it as conditional. In this sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome
that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any
story is arbitrary. Even if the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is
strong, the result is a framework in which reduced photosynthetic efficiency is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

   C. local adaptation alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates disease outbreaks.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because reduced photosynthetic efficiency uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on photophysiology measurements simple.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Caribbean reef tracts and everywhere else.

7. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that model assumptions is important mainly because:
   A. Since shifts in carbonate accretion is observed in Caribbean reef tracts, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. it prevents shifts in carbonate accretion from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control symbiont clade switching
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifts in carbonate accretion is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if photophysiology measurements produces a tight fit on one dataset.

8. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when shading and cooling refugia can mimic mortality and phase shifts.
   B. The passage suggests that mortality and phase shifts is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The author treats the Coral Triangle as a special case and argues that no broader inference about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves is possible.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving degree-heating-week metrics.

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where degree-heating-week metrics constrains symbiont clade switching
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'thermal bleaching events' refers to a different field altogether, not to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves.
   C. The discussion suggests that symbiont clade switching is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The passage implies that Caribbean reef tracts is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like symbiont clade switching make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting degree-heating-week metrics as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats degree-heating-week metrics as a historical curiosity and does not discuss reduced photosynthetic efficiency or symbiont clade switching. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that reduced photosynthetic efficiency is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how symbiont clade switching can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Caribbean reef tracts. Finally, it maintains that tests combining degree-heating-week metrics with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   D. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because reduced photosynthetic efficiency uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that symbiont clade switching is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using degree-heating-week metrics are unnecessary.
