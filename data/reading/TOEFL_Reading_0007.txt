Passage 0007: Why Bright LEDs Can Become Less Efficient at High Current (Physics)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 604)

An LED looks deceptively simple: a small chip that glows when current passes through it. The
glow, however, is the final step in a sequence that begins inside a semiconductor junction.
When a p‑type region rich in holes meets an n‑type region rich in electrons, an applied
voltage drives carriers toward the junction. If an electron recombines with a hole and
releases its energy as a photon, light is produced. If it releases energy as heat, the
device warms but does not brighten. The practical goal of LED design is therefore to bias
recombination toward photons.

For many years, engineers were puzzled by a stubborn pattern called “efficiency droop.” At
low to moderate current, an LED’s light output scales nearly linearly with current, and the
fraction of recombinations producing photons can be high. As current density increases,
however, the efficiency often falls even as more carriers are injected. The chip can become
brighter overall, yet it becomes less efficient per unit of current. The pattern matters in
applications that demand high brightness, because droop forces designers to use larger
arrays or more power to reach the same light level.

Several explanations competed. One account blamed heating: higher current raises
temperature, and higher temperature increases nonradiative pathways. Another account focused
on carrier leakage: carriers overflow the active region and recombine elsewhere without
emitting useful photons. A third account emphasized Auger recombination, a process in which
the energy of recombination is transferred to a third carrier rather than emitted as light.
[A] Under strong injection, Auger events become more probable because carrier densities rise
sharply, making three‑particle interactions less rare. [B] This mechanism predicts droop
even when the device is kept cool. [C]

A useful test comes from comparing devices under controlled temperature while varying
current density. In one study, a gallium nitride LED was mounted on a heat sink and held
near 25°C while current density was stepped from 5 to 40 A/cm². Light output rose steadily,
but the external quantum efficiency peaked near 15 A/cm² and then declined by roughly 20
percent by 40 A/cm². If heating were the dominant cause, holding temperature constant should
largely prevent droop, yet droop persisted. At the same time, leakage signatures—such as
unexpected emission from adjacent layers—were present but too small to explain the entire
drop. The data therefore pointed toward a mixed explanation: Auger recombination and leakage
both contribute, with their relative weights depending on the exact layer design and carrier
confinement.

Design changes illustrate this dependence. When engineers increase the thickness of the
active quantum wells or add a blocking layer that reduces electron overflow, droop can be
reduced, though often at the cost of higher operating voltage. Conversely, if the active
region is made too thick, carriers spread out, lowering radiative recombination rates and
reintroducing inefficiency through a different route. [D] The device behaves less like a
single “lamp” and more like a crowded intersection where routing matters: confine carriers
too little and they leak; confine them too much and interactions that waste energy become
frequent.

The lesson is not that droop has one villain, but that LED efficiency is governed by
competing pathways whose importance shifts with carrier density. By separating what happens
at low injection from what happens at high injection, engineers can match design choices to
intended use: a display pixel may never reach current densities where Auger dominates, while
a high‑power lamp might. The physics is microscopic, yet the consequence is visible to
anyone who expects an LED to become ever more efficient simply by pushing more current
through it.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, what is “efficiency droop”?
   A. A decline in LED efficient at high current density even as current continues to increase. This would occur only when p-type dominates.
   B. A decline in LED efficiency at high current density even as current continues to increase.
   C. A decline in LED efficiency at high current density even as current continues to increase. This outcome would hold even if current stays constant.
   D. A decline in LED efficiency at high current density even as current continues to decrease. This would occur only when current dominates.

   A. Heating alone cannot explain droop because densities still declined when temperature was held near constant. This would occur only when become dominates.
