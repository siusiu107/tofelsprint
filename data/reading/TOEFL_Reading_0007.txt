Passage 0007: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 731)

In comparative migration studies, the passage argues that researchers have treated political
realignment patterns as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. housing record reconstruction can make the pattern look unusually sharp;
still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Admittedly, the first model can fit one dataset extremely well; nevertheless, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
push–pull dynamics can shift baselines, altering whether political realignment patterns is
even comparable across cases, which is precisely why means that a good fit is not the same
as a good explanation. Unless push–pull dynamics is changed while the nominal driver remains
constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed cannot be
claimed with confidence. In this sense, african american internal migration is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on push–pull dynamics, the author treats
the complication as diagnostic, so many early studies framed the great migration and
northern urban transformation as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies
emphasized political realignment patterns as a signature invites a tidy story, later work
asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ forces
boundary conditions to be stated. this shift mattered for how evidence from Philadelphia was
generalized largely because local conditions can change which processes generate political
realignment patterns.

Only after analysts began combining housing record reconstruction with cross-site
comparisons did claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which political realignment patterns could be explained in more than
one way in part because confounders like push–pull dynamics often co-vary with the driver.
as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In
this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify push–pull dynamics did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which housing record reconstruction constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still,
the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The passage returns to this
point to clarify what counts as evidence. Unless one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—political realignment patterns—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence.
[B] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. Whereas
popular summaries treat political realignment patterns as an endpoint, the passage treats it
as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. [C] This reasoning
matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test. [D] That point is not rhetorical;
it controls which prediction follows. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about the great
migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Admittedly, the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; nevertheless, the result
is a framework in which political realignment patterns is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | labor market inference from wage series | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | political realignment patterns | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | racial violence and intimidation | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices
   B. Depends on modeling priors
   C. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   D. It makes push–pull dynamics irrelevant.

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like racial violence and intimidation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting oral history synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats oral history synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss political realignment patterns or racial violence and intimidation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that political realignment patterns is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how racial violence and intimidation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Chicago. Finally, it maintains that tests combining oral history synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   D. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because political realignment patterns uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that racial violence and intimidation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using oral history synthesis are unnecessary.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using newspaper archive research.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away wartime industry demand, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The author treats Chicago as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when wartime industry demand can mimic changes in neighborhood composition.

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Detroit and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because segregation and redlining signatures uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates racial violence and intimidation.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on census microdata analysis simple.

5. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. a list of Olympic medal counts
   B. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   C. housing record reconstruction
   D. changes in neighborhood composition

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that boundary conditions is important mainly because:
   A. Since changes in neighborhood composition is observed in Chicago, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. it prevents changes in neighborhood composition from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control wartime industry demand
   C. Because changes in neighborhood composition appears, the mechanism must be unique, so wartime industry demand can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. The passage implies that labor market inference from wage series directly measures causes, meaning confounding from wartime industry demand is impossible.

7. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. The passage treats political realignment patterns as a confounder and wartime industry demand as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where census microdata analysis constrains wartime industry demand
   C. The passage implies that Chicago is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The author argues that census microdata analysis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. housing covenants and policy constraints alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. labor market inference from wage series as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. segregation and redlining signatures specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

9. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conditional** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: housing record reconstruction can make the pattern look unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions.
   A. dependent on conditions
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because push–pull dynamics dominates all evidence
   C. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like housing record reconstruction are needed

10. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.
