Passage 0948: Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments (Psychology)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 714)

In replication efforts, the passage argues that researchers have treated metacognitive
illusions as the decisive sign of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments. Though
recognition tests can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain
why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike cross-cultural replications. The passage argues
that the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed
because encoding strength heterogeneity shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. So the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, and so, too, does
the evidence undermine treating metacognitive illusions as a self-sufficient conclusion. In
this sense, practice-driven suppression of competing memories is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

If anything is responsible, it is the apparent regularity of metacognitive illusions, and
therefore drives the first interpretation: metacognitive illusions is treated as a direct
readout of mechanism. Provided that metacognitive illusions is uniquely produced by one
causal pathway, then observations from cross-cultural replications would be transferable,
and disagreement would be largely technical. So the literature is full of such claims, and
so, too, does the evidence undermine the caveat that encoding strength heterogeneity might
reproduce the same pattern.

Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify encoding strength heterogeneity
was the field forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which recognition tests constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, retrieval-based inhibition is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of retrieval-induced
forgetting in memory experiments: inference is constrained by what competing models would
also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation, a different prediction
follows: then the same observation—metacognitive illusions—must be paired with tests that
change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat metacognitive
illusions as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. [A] The discussion makes clear that measurement
choices can masquerade as mechanism. Were one wishes to move from description to explanation
to fail, then the same observation—metacognitive illusions—must be paired with tests that
change the conditions under which it appears. [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but
as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Whereas popular summaries treat metacognitive
illusions as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. [C]
The author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. [D] The
author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. In
this sense, selective recall causing forgetting is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory
experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories
without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even though the temptation to treat a tidy
plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which metacognitive
illusions is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

   D. fMRI pattern analysis

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. The author argues that pre-registered replication should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The passage treats strategy shifts over trials as a confounder and encoding strength heterogeneity as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'practice-driven suppression of competing memories' refers to a different field altogether, not to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where pre-registered replication constrains encoding strength heterogeneity

3. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | recognition tests | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | context-dependent effects | Can be contaminated by background variability |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It makes test expectancy effects irrelevant.
   B. Can be contaminated by background variability
   C. It proves metacognitive illusions is unique.
   D. Co-varies with the driver of interest

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **coherent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because stress modulation of recall dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments, serving only as background detail
   C. well organized
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like process-dissociation procedures are needed

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-cultural replications and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because metacognitive illusions uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates encoding strength heterogeneity.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on process-dissociation procedures simple.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. The passage implies that pre-registered replication directly measures causes, meaning confounding from encoding strength heterogeneity is impossible.
   B. Because encoding strength heterogeneity co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. it prevents context-dependent effects from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control encoding strength heterogeneity
   D. Since context-dependent effects is observed in clinical populations, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

7. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. pre-registered replication as a device rather than as an analytic approach

   C. stress modulation of recall alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

8. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away stress modulation of recall, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving paired-associate tasks.
   C. The author treats classroom study settings as a special case and argues that no broader inference about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments is possible.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when stress modulation of recall can mimic reduced recall of unpracticed items.

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments and argues that metacognitive illusions is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how inhibitory control differences can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-cultural replications. Finally, it maintains that tests combining pre-registered replication with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about practice-driven suppression of competing memories robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats pre-registered replication as a historical curiosity and does not discuss metacognitive illusions or inhibitory control differences. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that retrieval-based inhibition is settled because metacognitive illusions uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that inhibitory control differences is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using pre-registered replication are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that selective recall causing forgetting cannot be studied empirically because confounders like inhibitory control differences make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting pre-registered replication as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
