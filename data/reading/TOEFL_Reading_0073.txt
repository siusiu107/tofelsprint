Passage 0073: The Dust Bowl and the Reinvention of Soil
=======================================================
(Word count: 613)

In the early twentieth century, the Great Plains were often described as an American granary
waiting to be unlocked. New wheat varieties, tractors, and expanding rail networks
encouraged farmers to plow prairie grasslands that had evolved under drought, fire, and
grazing. When prices rose during World War I, cultivation surged; when prices fell, many
farmers planted even more in an attempt to compensate with volume. The result was an
agricultural landscape that, within a generation, had replaced deep- rooted perennial
grasses with shallow-rooted annual crops.

Then the climate shifted. During the 1930s, a multi-year drought gripped the Plains, and the
winds that had always swept the region encountered bare, pulverized topsoil. Without the
binding effect of grass roots and organic matter, fields dried, crumbled, and became
airborne. Dust storms—some so dense that midday resembled dusk—carried soil across states
and even across the Atlantic. For families, the disaster was both physical and economic:
dust infiltrated homes and lungs, crops failed, and debt became a trap. [A] The Dust Bowl
was not simply “bad weather”; it was drought amplified by land-use choices.

The catastrophe forced a change in how soil was understood. Rather than treating soil as
inert dirt, conservationists argued that it was a living structure with aggregates, pores,
and organic components that could be rebuilt or destroyed. In response, the U.S. government
created the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in 1935, led by Hugh Hammond Bennett, who used
both scientific demonstrations and political persuasion. Bennett emphasized that erosion was
not inevitable; it was a consequence of exposed surfaces and poor moisture retention.

Conservation practices targeted wind and water. Contour plowing and strip cropping reduced
runoff on slopes, while leaving crop residue on fields reduced wind shear at the surface.
Planting cover crops and returning manure increased organic matter, which improved
aggregation and water-holding capacity. Shelterbelts—rows of trees planted as
windbreaks—altered near-surface airflow, reducing the wind speed that could lift particles.
None of these practices eliminated drought, but they changed how drought translated into
erosion. [B] By keeping the soil surface rougher, moister, and more anchored, conservation
reduced the chance that a dry year would become a regional dust crisis.

The social response was uneven. Some farmers adopted new practices quickly; others resisted,
either because they doubted the science, lacked capital, or resented federal intervention.
Moreover, the Dust Bowl’s effects were entwined with tenancy and inequality. Tenant farmers
and sharecroppers, who often had little control over land management decisions, were
particularly vulnerable to displacement, and many migrated west. Thus, soil conservation was
not only an agronomic project but also a political one, because it redistributed advice,
subsidies, and, indirectly, power.

The Dust Bowl also reshaped research. It stimulated studies of drought cycles, prairie
ecology, and the role of grasslands in stabilizing carbon and moisture. Later, when
irrigation from the Ogallala Aquifer expanded, it created a different bargain: water could
stabilize yields, yet groundwater depletion would become a new constraint. The Plains,
therefore, remained a place where climate and land use negotiated continuously.

The Dust Bowl is remembered through images of black clouds and abandoned farms, but its
deeper lesson is structural. [C] When a landscape is simplified for short-term gain, it can
become brittle, and an ordinary climatic stress can become a systemic failure. [D]

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Rather than treating soil as inert dirt, conservationists argued that it was a living structure with aggregates, pores, and organic components that could be rebuilt or destroyed.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to moisture and increased
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across shelterbelts
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of shelterbelts

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains drought by linking moisture to increased, and it shows why shelterbelts changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents increased as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once moisture is observed, competing explanations for drought collapse. It treats shelterbelts as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage concedes that moisture is often incomplete and concludes that drought cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since shelterbelts overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of increased with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   D. The passage surveys drought but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed increased first, with moisture serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats shelterbelts as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, for the phenomenon at issue.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how drought should change if shelterbelts is altered, instead of assuming that moisture has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to increased must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage treats moisture primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over increased are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about drought are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in shelterbelts, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of moisture is enough to validate increased for drought, especially regarding shelterbelts, for the main claim of the text.
   D. The passage implies that shelterbelts mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes moisture effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of increased no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain drought, for the main claim of the text.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of shelterbelts as a factor influencing moisture
   B. discussion of calibration drift as a factor influencing moisture
   C. discussion of increased as a factor influencing moisture
   D. discussion of drought as a factor influencing moisture, in the examples provided.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Rather than treating soil as inert dirt, conservationists argued that it was a living structure with aggregates, pores, and organic components that could be rebuilt or destroyed.
   A. Rather than treating soil as inert dirt. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   B. Rather than treating soil as inert dirt. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once moisture fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and shelterbelts can be ignored without changing conclusions about drought.
   B. Because the presence of increased guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in shelterbelts are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because moisture directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding drought.
   D. Because comparability prevents increased from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold shelterbelts constant while examining moisture.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | moisture | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | shelterbelts | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It proves increased is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that drought should be read alongside shelterbelts, because moisture alone does not settle what increased means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "these" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: None of these practices eliminated drought, but they changed how drought translated into erosion.
   A. the idea that [B] By keeping the soil surface rougher, moister, and more anchored, conservation reduced the chance that a dry year would become a regional dust.
   B. the idea that Tenant farmers and sharecroppers, who often had little control over land management decisions, were particularly vulnerable to displacement, and many migrated west
   C. the idea that Planting cover crops and returning manure increased organic matter, which improved aggregation and water-holding capacity, in the context of the passage.
   D. the idea that Shelterbelts—rows of trees planted as windbreaks—altered near-surface airflow, reducing the wind speed that could lift particles
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses increased, so debate over moisture is unnecessary noise, in the cases described, especially regarding farmers.
   B. to show that the term drought belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of moisture lead to different conclusions about drought.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of moisture and increased should be abandoned altogether.
