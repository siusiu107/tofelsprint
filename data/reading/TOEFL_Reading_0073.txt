Passage 0073: The Dust Bowl and the Reinvention of Soil
=======================================================
(Word count: 613)

In the early twentieth century, the Great Plains were often described as an American granary
waiting to be unlocked. New wheat varieties, tractors, and expanding rail networks
encouraged farmers to plow prairie grasslands that had evolved under drought, fire, and
grazing. When prices rose during World War I, cultivation surged; when prices fell, many
farmers planted even more in an attempt to compensate with volume. The result was an
agricultural landscape that, within a generation, had replaced deep- rooted perennial
grasses with shallow-rooted annual crops.

Then the climate shifted. During the 1930s, a multi-year drought gripped the Plains, and the
winds that had always swept the region encountered bare, pulverized topsoil. Without the
binding effect of grass roots and organic matter, fields dried, crumbled, and became
airborne. Dust storms—some so dense that midday resembled dusk—carried soil across states
and even across the Atlantic. For families, the disaster was both physical and economic:
dust infiltrated homes and lungs, crops failed, and debt became a trap. [A] The Dust Bowl
was not simply “bad weather”; it was drought amplified by land-use choices.

The catastrophe forced a change in how soil was understood. Rather than treating soil as
inert dirt, conservationists argued that it was a living structure with aggregates, pores,
and organic components that could be rebuilt or destroyed. In response, the U.S. government
created the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in 1935, led by Hugh Hammond Bennett, who used
both scientific demonstrations and political persuasion. Bennett emphasized that erosion was
not inevitable; it was a consequence of exposed surfaces and poor moisture retention.

Conservation practices targeted wind and water. Contour plowing and strip cropping reduced
runoff on slopes, while leaving crop residue on fields reduced wind shear at the surface.
Planting cover crops and returning manure increased organic matter, which improved
aggregation and water-holding capacity. Shelterbelts—rows of trees planted as
windbreaks—altered near-surface airflow, reducing the wind speed that could lift particles.
None of these practices eliminated drought, but they changed how drought translated into
erosion. [B] By keeping the soil surface rougher, moister, and more anchored, conservation
reduced the chance that a dry year would become a regional dust crisis.

The social response was uneven. Some farmers adopted new practices quickly; others resisted,
either because they doubted the science, lacked capital, or resented federal intervention.
Moreover, the Dust Bowl’s effects were entwined with tenancy and inequality. Tenant farmers
and sharecroppers, who often had little control over land management decisions, were
particularly vulnerable to displacement, and many migrated west. Thus, soil conservation was
not only an agronomic project but also a political one, because it redistributed advice,
subsidies, and, indirectly, power.

The Dust Bowl also reshaped research. It stimulated studies of drought cycles, prairie
ecology, and the role of grasslands in stabilizing carbon and moisture. Later, when
irrigation from the Ogallala Aquifer expanded, it created a different bargain: water could
stabilize yields, yet groundwater depletion would become a new constraint. The Plains,
therefore, remained a place where climate and land use negotiated continuously.

The Dust Bowl is remembered through images of black clouds and abandoned farms, but its
deeper lesson is structural. [C] When a landscape is simplified for short-term gain, it can
become brittle, and an ordinary climatic stress can become a systemic failure. [D]

Where shelterbelts survived, snow deposition increased and spring soil moisture lasted
longer, slightly buffering later droughts.

Questions
---------
1. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author emphasize that the Dust Bowl was “drought amplified by land-use choices”?
   A. To argue that human cultivation practices increased vulnerability to wind erosion during drought.
   B. To argue that human cultivation practices increased vulnerability to wind erosion during drought. This outcome would hold even if contour stays constant.
   C. To argue that human cultivation practices increased vulnerability to wind erosion during drought. This would occur only when where dominates.
   D. To argue that human cultivation service increased vulnerability to wind erosion during drought. This outcome would hold even if landscape stays constant.


2. [Factual] According to the passage, what institutional response was created in 1935 to address erosion?
   A. the Soil where Service (SCS). This would occur only when reinvention dominates.
   B. the Soil Conservation Service (SCS).
   C. the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). That would make conservation the primary constraint.
   D. the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). This would occur only when plains dominates.


3. [Vocabulary] The word “brittle” in the final paragraph is closest in meaning to:
   A. unable to be measured scientifically
   B. easily damaged or prone to collapse under stress
   C. permanently wet and waterlogged
   D. extremely fertile and resilient


4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Once the protective grass cover was removed, the soil’s stability depended largely on how fields were managed from season to season.
   A. [C]
   B. [D]
   C. [A]
   D. [B]

   A. using perovskite layers to convert sunlight into electricity.
   B. leaving crop residue and planting cover crops.
   C. shelterbelts as windbreaks in this discussion.
   D. strip cropping and contour plowing in this discussion.


6. [Inference] What can be inferred about why some farmers resisted conservation practices?
   A. They may solely have faced financial constraints or skepticism and sometimes resented federal involvement. That would make ogallala the primary constraint.
   B. They must have faced financial constraints or skepticism and sometimes resented federal involvement. That would make deposition the primary constraint.
   C. They may have faced financial constraints or skepticism and sometimes resented federal involvement by tying the effect to aquifer.
   D. They may have faced financial constraints or skepticism and sometimes resented federal involvement.


7. [Reference] In the passage, “None of these practices” refers to:
   A. the set of conservation strategies aimed at reducing erosion and improving soil structure. This outcome would hold even if later stays constant.
   B. the set of conservation strategies aimed at reducing erosion and improving soil structure. This would require conservation to be the limiting factor.
   C. the set of conservation strategies aimed at reducing erosion and improving soil structure.
   D. the set of tenant strategies aimed at reducing erosion and improving soil structure. This outcome would hold even if landscape stays constant.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It describes agricultural expansion and vulnerability, explains how drought and wind produced dust storms, then outlines conservation responses, social unevenness, and longer-term research implications. This would require bennett to be the limiting factor.
   B. It describes agricultural expansion and vulnerability, explains how drought and wind produced dust storms, then outlines conservation responses, social unevenness, and longer-term research implications. This would occur only when rather dominates.
   C. It describes agricultural expansion and vulnerability, explains how drought and wind produced dust storms, then outlines practices responses, social unevenness, and longer-term research implications. This would require world to be the limiting factor.
   D. It describes agricultural expansion and vulnerability, explains how drought and wind produced dust storms, then outlines conservation responses, social unevenness, and longer-term research implications.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates Bennett’s claim that erosion was not inevitable?
   A. By changing management—keeping soil covered and anchored—people could reduce how severely wind and water removed soil by tying the effect to conservation.
   B. By changing management—keeping soil covered and anchored—people could reduce how severely wind and water removed soil. That would make great the primary constraint.
   C. By changing management—keeping soil covered and anchored—people could reduce how severely wind and water removed soil.
   D. By changing management—keeping soil covered and anchored—people could amplify how severely wind and water removed soil. This outcome would hold even if tenant stays constant.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage explains how intensive plowing of prairie grasslands increased susceptibility to drought and wind in the 1930s, producing devastating dust storms, and it describes the rise of soil conservation through the SCS and practices such as residue retention and shelterbelts, while noting social resistance and the continuing negotiation between land use and climate on the Plains.
