Passage 0073: The Dust Bowl and the Reinvention of Soil
=======================================================
(Word count: 613)

In the early twentieth century, the Great Plains were often described as an American granary
waiting to be unlocked. New wheat varieties, tractors, and expanding rail networks
encouraged farmers to plow prairie grasslands that had evolved under drought, fire, and
grazing. When prices rose during World War I, cultivation surged; when prices fell, many
farmers planted even more in an attempt to compensate with volume. The result was an
agricultural landscape that, within a generation, had replaced deep- rooted perennial
grasses with shallow-rooted annual crops.

Then the climate shifted. During the 1930s, a multi-year drought gripped the Plains, and the
winds that had always swept the region encountered bare, pulverized topsoil. Without the
binding effect of grass roots and organic matter, fields dried, crumbled, and became
airborne. Dust storms—some so dense that midday resembled dusk—carried soil across states
and even across the Atlantic. For families, the disaster was both physical and economic:
dust infiltrated homes and lungs, crops failed, and debt became a trap. [A] The Dust Bowl
was not simply “bad weather”; it was drought amplified by land-use choices.

The catastrophe forced a change in how soil was understood. Rather than treating soil as
inert dirt, conservationists argued that it was a living structure with aggregates, pores,
and organic components that could be rebuilt or destroyed. In response, the U.S. government
created the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) in 1935, led by Hugh Hammond Bennett, who used
both scientific demonstrations and political persuasion. Bennett emphasized that erosion was
not inevitable; it was a consequence of exposed surfaces and poor moisture retention.

Conservation practices targeted wind and water. Contour plowing and strip cropping reduced
runoff on slopes, while leaving crop residue on fields reduced wind shear at the surface.
Planting cover crops and returning manure increased organic matter, which improved
aggregation and water-holding capacity. Shelterbelts—rows of trees planted as
windbreaks—altered near-surface airflow, reducing the wind speed that could lift particles.
None of these practices eliminated drought, but they changed how drought translated into
erosion. [B] By keeping the soil surface rougher, moister, and more anchored, conservation
reduced the chance that a dry year would become a regional dust crisis.

The social response was uneven. Some farmers adopted new practices quickly; others resisted,
either because they doubted the science, lacked capital, or resented federal intervention.
Moreover, the Dust Bowl’s effects were entwined with tenancy and inequality. Tenant farmers
and sharecroppers, who often had little control over land management decisions, were
particularly vulnerable to displacement, and many migrated west. Thus, soil conservation was
not only an agronomic project but also a political one, because it redistributed advice,
subsidies, and, indirectly, power.

The Dust Bowl also reshaped research. It stimulated studies of drought cycles, prairie
ecology, and the role of grasslands in stabilizing carbon and moisture. Later, when
irrigation from the Ogallala Aquifer expanded, it created a different bargain: water could
stabilize yields, yet groundwater depletion would become a new constraint. The Plains,
therefore, remained a place where climate and land use negotiated continuously.

The Dust Bowl is remembered through images of black clouds and abandoned farms, but its
deeper lesson is structural. [C] When a landscape is simplified for short-term gain, it can
become brittle, and an ordinary climatic stress can become a systemic failure. [D]

Where shelterbelts survived, snow deposition increased and spring soil moisture lasted
longer, slightly buffering later droughts.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author emphasize that the Dust Bowl was “drought amplified by land-use choices”?
   A. To argue that human cultivation practices increased vulnerability to wind erosion during drought
   B. To claim that drought played no role in the crisis
   C. To suggest that prairie grasses had no effect on soil stability
   D. To show that dust storms were caused mainly by volcanic ash

2. [Factual] According to the passage, what institutional response was created in 1935 to address erosion?
   A. the Soil Conservation Service (SCS)
   B. the National Aeronautics Agency
   C. the Federal Ultramarine Commission
   D. the Urban Heat Bureau

3. [Vocabulary] The word “brittle” in the final paragraph is closest in meaning to:
   A. easily damaged or prone to collapse under stress
   B. extremely fertile and resilient
   C. permanently wet and waterlogged
   D. unable to be measured scientifically

4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Once the protective grass cover was removed, the soil’s stability depended largely on how fields were managed from season to season.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following conservation practices are mentioned EXCEPT:
   A. strip cropping and contour plowing
   B. leaving crop residue and planting cover crops
   C. shelterbelts as windbreaks
   D. using perovskite layers to convert sunlight into electricity

6. [Inference] What can be inferred about why some farmers resisted conservation practices?
   A. They may have faced financial constraints or skepticism and sometimes resented federal involvement
   B. They believed trees always increase wind speed on farms
   C. They had unlimited capital and therefore ignored advice
   D. They opposed conservation only because rainfall was increasing

7. [Reference] In the passage, “None of these practices” refers to:
   A. the set of conservation strategies aimed at reducing erosion and improving soil structure
   B. the policy debates about urban heat mitigation
   C. the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance
   D. the trade routes that supplied lapis lazuli

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It describes agricultural expansion and vulnerability, explains how drought and wind produced dust storms, then outlines conservation responses, social unevenness, and longer-term research implications
   B. It provides only a year-by-year list of dust storms
   C. It argues that the Plains were never cultivated before 1930
   D. It focuses exclusively on westward migration without soil discussion

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates Bennett’s claim that erosion was not inevitable?
   A. By changing management—keeping soil covered and anchored—people could reduce how severely wind and water removed soil
   B. Only natural cycles determine erosion, so farming practices do not matter
   C. Erosion stops automatically when tractors are introduced
   D. Soil cannot be rebuilt once it is disturbed

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The Dust Bowl was caused solely by falling wheat prices and not by climate.
   B. The passage explains how intensive plowing of prairie grasslands increased susceptibility to drought and wind in the 1930s, producing devastating dust storms, and it describes the rise of soil conservation through the SCS and practices such as residue retention and shelterbelts, while noting social resistance and the continuing negotiation between land use and climate on the Plains.
   C. Soil conservation eliminated drought on the Great Plains by increasing rainfall.
   D. Farmers universally adopted conservation immediately because it required no investment.
