Passage 0294: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 792)

Despite local variability, the analysis suggests researchers have treated mortality and
phase shifts as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves. Although
degree-heating-week metrics can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues
that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for;
this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives. Never before analysts began combining degree-heating-week metrics with
cross-site comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about coral bleaching
triggered by marine heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. [A] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference
rather than as an embarrassment. the goal was to break degeneracies in which mortality and
phase shifts could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like local
adaptation often co-vary with the driver. [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a
disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. as the author notes, transparency about priors became
an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable. [C] The author suggests that the same evidence can support
multiple stories when priors differ. [D] The passage highlights that mechanism claims must
survive out-of-sample checks. In this sense, thermal bleaching events is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. If anything is responsible, it is
methodological humility, and therefore the passage presents as the lesson of coral bleaching
triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. Provided that one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same
observation—mortality and phase shifts—must be paired with tests that change the conditions
under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat mortality and phase shifts as an
endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental
or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. Not until analysts
began combining degree-heating-week metrics with cross-site comparisons did claims about
coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which mortality
and phase shifts could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like
local adaptation often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. Even if the first model can fit one
dataset extremely well, the passage insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown,
not assumed. it highlights how local adaptation can shift baselines, altering whether
mortality and phase shifts is even comparable across cases, something that means that a good
fit is not the same as a good explanation. Provided that local adaptation is changed while
the nominal driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions
are perturbed. In this sense, loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Using degree-heating-week
metrics under stable conditions, the argument reframes the issue so that one frequently
cited case from the Coral Triangle appeared to support the direct-readout view. Though the
original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts
in local adaptation altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic mortality and phase shifts.
the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which forces analysts to admit that
illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted.
Not the obvious explanation but the apparent regularity of mortality and phase shifts is
what drives the first interpretation: mortality and phase shifts is treated as a direct
readout of mechanism. If mortality and phase shifts is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway, a different prediction follows: then observations from the Coral Triangle would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. So the literature is full of such
claims, and so, too, does the evidence undermine the caveat that local adaptation might
reproduce the same pattern. In this sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, the central disagreement
can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is
often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims
about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when shading and cooling refugia can mimic recruitment failure.
   B. The author treats Caribbean reef tracts as a special case and argues that no broader inference about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves is possible.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away shading and cooling refugia, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving degree-heating-week metrics.

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The passage implies that Caribbean reef tracts is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author argues that satellite thermal stress maps should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage treats changes in reef fish assemblages as a confounder and shading and cooling refugia as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where satellite thermal stress maps constrains shading and cooling refugia

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The passage implies that 'noise' is sometimes a label for unmodeled structure rather than a property of the world itself.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Caribbean reef tracts and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because recruitment failure uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates compound stressors such as acidification and pollution.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on satellite thermal stress maps simple.

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that changes in reef fish assemblages is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how local adaptation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Coral Triangle. Finally, it maintains that tests combining degree-heating-week metrics with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   B. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like local adaptation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting degree-heating-week metrics as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because changes in reef fish assemblages uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that local adaptation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using degree-heating-week metrics are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats degree-heating-week metrics as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in reef fish assemblages or local adaptation. It ends without any methodological implication.

6. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **preliminary** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the goal was to break degeneracies in which mortality and phase shifts could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like local adaptation often co-vary with the driver.
   A. irrelevant to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves, serving only as background detail
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like symbiont genotyping are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because shading and cooling refugia dominates all evidence
   D. early

7. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize confounder control?
   A. The passage implies that photophysiology measurements directly measures causes, meaning confounding from local adaptation is impossible.
   B. Since mortality and phase shifts is observed in Red Sea reefs, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. it prevents mortality and phase shifts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control local adaptation
   D. Because local adaptation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
