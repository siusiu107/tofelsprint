Passage 0179: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 800)

In twentieth-century urban histories, the passage argues that researchers have treated
segregation and redlining signatures as the decisive sign of the great migration and
northern urban transformation. Despite the fact that housing record reconstruction can make
the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Using housing record
reconstruction under stable conditions, the interpretation shifts, and one frequently cited
case from Detroit appeared to support the direct-readout view. Even if the original fit
looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in push–pull
dynamics altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic segregation and redlining signatures.
the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which forces analysts to admit that
illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. In
this sense, african american internal migration is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label. If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and
therefore the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban
transformation: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one
wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—segregation and
redlining signatures—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat segregation and redlining signatures as an
endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts. Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify
push–pull dynamics occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which housing record reconstruction constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. Never before analysts began combining housing
record reconstruction with cross-site comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims
about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped relying on a single
figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in
which segregation and redlining signatures could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like push–pull dynamics often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication
matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Hardly had analysts began combining

author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. Working with sparse records and limited controls on push–pull dynamics, it is
difficult to deny that many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban
transformation as a single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] The passage frames uncertainty as an
ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment. Whereas those studies emphasized
segregation and redlining signatures as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether
the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive
under replication. [B] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead
to a different conclusion. this shift mattered for how evidence from Detroit was generalized
because local conditions can change which processes generate segregation and redlining
signatures. [C] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be
discarded. [D] The author suggests that the same evidence can support multiple stories when
priors differ. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, the passage concludes that
the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into
the open. by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban
transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying
that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict.
   A. push–pull dynamics alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. census microdata analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. political realignment patterns specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conditional** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Despite the fact that housing record reconstruction can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like census microdata analysis are needed
   B. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   C. dependent on conditions
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because push–pull dynamics dominates all evidence

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that segregation and redlining signatures is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how push–pull dynamics can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Chicago. Finally, it maintains that tests combining oral history synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats oral history synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss segregation and redlining signatures or push–pull dynamics. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like push–pull dynamics make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting oral history synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because segregation and redlining signatures uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that push–pull dynamics is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using oral history synthesis are unnecessary.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. segregation and redlining signatures
   B. labor market inference from wage series
   C. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   D. a list of Olympic medal counts

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the passage juxtapose two accounts of the phenomenon?
   A. The author argues that labor market inference from wage series should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where labor market inference from wage series constrains housing covenants and policy constraints
   C. The discussion suggests that housing covenants and policy constraints is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The passage implies that Philadelphia is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

6. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when housing covenants and policy constraints can mimic political realignment patterns.
   B. The passage suggests that political realignment patterns is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away housing covenants and policy constraints, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving housing record reconstruction.

7. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. it prevents political realignment patterns from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control wartime industry demand
   B. Because political realignment patterns appears, the mechanism must be unique, so wartime industry demand can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if census microdata analysis produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once political realignment patterns is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The author notes that a single dramatic example can mislead if it is treated as representative rather than as diagnostic.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on census microdata analysis simple.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates racial violence and intimidation.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Chicago and everywhere else.
