Passage 0952: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 711)

Despite elegant mechanistic cartoons, the analysis suggests researchers have treated
poisoning by CO as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Even
if microkinetic modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that
such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting
debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, something
that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike industrial hydrogenation reactors. [A] At first
glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because, as the
author notes, catalyst deactivation shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. [B] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. The issue is not
treating poisoning by CO as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore
separates detection from interpretation. [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier
interpretation is narrowed. [D] The author suggests that the same evidence can support
multiple stories when priors differ. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation,
a different prediction follows: then the same observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries
treat poisoning by CO as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts.

The point is not X but the apparent regularity of poisoning by CO; in that framing, drives
the first interpretation: poisoning by CO is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. If
poisoning by CO is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, a different prediction follows:
then observations from industrial hydrogenation reactors would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. So the literature is full of such claims, and so,
too, does the evidence undermine the caveat that catalyst deactivation might reproduce the
same pattern. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of heterogeneous
catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. Should one wishes to move from description to explanation be true, then the same
observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which
it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat poisoning by CO as an endpoint is easy to
measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst deactivation,
does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which microkinetic modeling constrains alternatives, researchers could
ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic;
nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even if
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which poisoning by CO is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions
rather than through habit.

Questions

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing theories?
   A. The author argues that surface microscopy should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where surface microscopy constrains facet dependence
   D. The discussion suggests that facet dependence is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | in situ spectroscopy | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | structure-sensitive activity | May be muted by other processes |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Can mimic the target feature
   B. May be muted by other processes

   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on DFT surface modeling simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates catalyst deactivation.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selectivity shifts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in industrial hydrogenation reactors and everywhere else.

   A. temperature-programmed desorption
   B. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   C. the length of the Nile in miles
   D. structure-sensitive activity

7. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when adsorbate coverage effects can mimic structure-sensitive activity.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away adsorbate coverage effects, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving microkinetic modeling.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using microkinetic modeling.

8. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **plausible** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.
   A. reasonable
   B. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because catalyst deactivation dominates all evidence
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like DFT surface modeling are needed

9. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that DFT surface modeling directly measures causes, meaning confounding from catalyst deactivation is impossible.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if DFT surface modeling produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. Because catalyst deactivation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. it prevents poisoning by CO from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control catalyst deactivation

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like facet dependence make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting in situ spectroscopy as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that rate enhancement is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how facet dependence can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from industrial hydrogenation reactors. Finally, it maintains that tests combining in situ spectroscopy with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   C. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because rate enhancement uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that facet dependence is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using in situ spectroscopy are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats in situ spectroscopy as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rate enhancement or facet dependence. It ends without any methodological implication.
