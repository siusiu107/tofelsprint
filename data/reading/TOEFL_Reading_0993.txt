Passage 0993: Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments (Psychology)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 621)

From a cognitive-control perspective, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated context-dependent effects as the decisive sign of retrieval-induced
forgetting in memory experiments. Although recognition tests can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using recognition tests under stable conditions, the key question becomes whether one
frequently cited case from cross-cultural replications appeared to support the direct-
readout view. Granted that the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in encoding strength heterogeneity altered the baseline
enough to mute or mimic context-dependent effects. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, which illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted. In this sense, practice-driven suppression of competing
memories is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

While it is true that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
encoding strength heterogeneity can shift baselines, altering whether context-dependent
effects is even comparable across cases, which helps explain why means that a good fit is
not the same as a good explanation. If encoding strength heterogeneity is changed while the
nominal driver remains constant is granted, one should expect different outcomes when
conditions are perturbed.

If anything is responsible, it is the apparent regularity of context-dependent effects, and
therefore drives the first interpretation: context-dependent effects is treated as a direct
readout of mechanism. [A] The author notes that generalization requires more than a single
well-chosen case. If context-dependent effects is uniquely produced by one causal pathway is
granted, then observations from cross-cultural replications would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what
counts as a decisive test. So the literature is full of such claims, and so, too, does the
evidence undermine the caveat that encoding strength heterogeneity might reproduce the same
pattern. [C] The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols are
comparable. [D] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. In
this sense, retrieval-based inhibition is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

Only through analysts began combining recognition tests with cross-site comparisons could
one reasonably claim that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which context-dependent effects could be explained in more than
one way because confounders like encoding strength heterogeneity often co-vary with the
driver, which is why replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors
became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, selective recall causing forgetting is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about retrieval-
induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even though the temptation to
treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which
context-dependent effects is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that process-dissociation procedures directly measures causes, meaning confounding from encoding strength heterogeneity is impossible.
   B. it prevents context-dependent effects from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control encoding strength heterogeneity
   C. Since context-dependent effects is observed in laboratory paradigms, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because encoding strength heterogeneity co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: As a result, the most valuable observations are often taken during transitions, when competing mechanisms diverge most clearly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because reduced recall of unpracticed items uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates stress modulation of recall.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in laboratory paradigms and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on fMRI pattern analysis simple.

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that retrieval-based inhibition is settled because context-dependent effects uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that inhibitory control differences is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using paired-associate tasks are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats paired-associate tasks as a historical curiosity and does not discuss context-dependent effects or inhibitory control differences. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that selective recall causing forgetting cannot be studied empirically because confounders like inhibitory control differences make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting paired-associate tasks as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments and argues that context-dependent effects is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how inhibitory control differences can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-cultural replications. Finally, it maintains that tests combining paired-associate tasks with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about practice-driven suppression of competing memories robust.

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using recognition tests.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when test expectancy effects can mimic context-dependent effects.
   C. The passage suggests that context-dependent effects is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author treats laboratory paradigms as a special case and argues that no broader inference about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments is possible.

6. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   B. It proves strategy shifts over trials is unique.
   C. Samples only part of the system
   D. It makes inhibitory control differences irrelevant.

   Sentence: [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. test expectancy effects alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. process-dissociation procedures as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. context-dependent effects specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The passage implies that classroom study settings is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author argues that recognition tests should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where recognition tests constrains stress modulation of recall
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'selective recall causing forgetting' refers to a different field altogether, not to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments.

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
