Passage 0326: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 661)

In comparative migration studies, researchers have treated shifts in industrial labor demand
as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban transformation. To be sure,
oral history synthesis can make the pattern look unusually sharp, yet the passage argues
that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, an
outcome that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify racial violence and intimidation
was the field forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which oral history synthesis constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is
precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even
if a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, african american internal
migration is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only when analysts began combining oral history synthesis with cross-site comparisons did
claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which shifts in industrial labor demand could be explained in more than one
way largely because confounders like racial violence and intimidation often co-vary with the
driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than
a stylistic choice, which changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move from description
to explanation, then the same observation—shifts in industrial labor demand—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries
treat shifts in industrial labor demand as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats
it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically
revealing. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Although the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. [A] The author uses the detour to
show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. it highlights how racial
violence and intimidation can shift baselines, altering whether shifts in industrial labor
demand is even comparable across cases, which is precisely why means that a good fit is not
the same as a good explanation. [B] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of
treating them as afterthoughts. Should racial violence and intimidation is changed while the
nominal driver remains constant be true, one should expect different outcomes when
conditions are perturbed. [C] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. [D] The passage
signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. In this sense, twentieth-century
black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Even if the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is
a framework in which shifts in industrial labor demand is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the passage juxtapose two accounts of the phenomenon?
   A. The passage treats changes in neighborhood composition as a confounder and wartime industry demand as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where census microdata analysis constrains wartime industry demand
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'African American internal migration' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   D. The passage implies that Philadelphia is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **subtle** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: To be sure, oral history synthesis can make the pattern look unusually sharp, yet the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions.
   A. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   B. slight
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like labor market inference from wage series are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because wartime industry demand dominates all evidence

3. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | labor market inference from wage series | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | shifts in industrial labor demand | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | housing covenants and policy constraints | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   B. Can be contaminated by background variability
   C. It proves segregation and redlining signatures is unique.
   D. Requires careful calibration

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like push–pull dynamics make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting census microdata analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats census microdata analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifts in industrial labor demand or push–pull dynamics. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that push–pull dynamics is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using census microdata analysis are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that shifts in industrial labor demand is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how push–pull dynamics can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Chicago. Finally, it maintains that tests combining census microdata analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when racial violence and intimidation can mimic shifts in industrial labor demand.
   B. The author treats Detroit as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using newspaper archive research.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away racial violence and intimidation, since variability is merely a measurement error.

6. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. changes in neighborhood composition
   B. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   C. a recipe for bread fermentation
   D. census microdata analysis

7. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. The passage implies that labor market inference from wage series directly measures causes, meaning confounding from wartime industry demand is impossible.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once changes in neighborhood composition is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. it prevents changes in neighborhood composition from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control wartime industry demand
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if labor market inference from wage series produces a tight fit on one dataset.

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Provided that one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—shifts in industrial labor demand—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. oral history synthesis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. racial violence and intimidation alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. political realignment patterns specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This point matters because the simplest interpretation often survives only by silently restricting the range of cases under discussion.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

10. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Harlem and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on housing record reconstruction simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates push–pull dynamics.
