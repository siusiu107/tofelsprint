Passage 0216: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 799)

When adoption is measured in aggregates, one sees why researchers have treated disparate
exposure to pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Admittedly, spatial autocorrelation analysis can make the pattern
look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional
and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data
collection than about what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. In replication
attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were
applied in settings unlike European migrant neighborhoods. The passage argues that the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because
zoning rules and land-use regulation shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation—not treating disparate
exposure to pollution as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, spatial stratification
in cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. If
anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage presents
as the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The author shifts
from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. Provided that one
wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—disparate exposure
to pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
[B] The author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case.
Whereas popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint may be
convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. [C] This point forces the reader to
consider how confounders enter the pipeline. [D] The discussion makes clear that measurement
choices can masquerade as mechanism. Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or
stratify zoning rules and land-use regulation was it defensible to argue that the debate
became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which
spatial autocorrelation analysis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. Hardly had analysts began combining spatial autocorrelation analysis with
cross-site comparisons occurred when claims about residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate
exposure to pollution could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
zoning rules and land-use regulation often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is
precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense,
segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. Only after analysts began combining spatial
autocorrelation analysis with cross-site comparisons did claims about residential
segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single
figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in
which disparate exposure to pollution could be explained in more than one way because, as
the author notes, confounders like zoning rules and land-use regulation often co-vary with
the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify zoning rules and
land-use regulation was the field forced to accept that the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which spatial
autocorrelation analysis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. Even if a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense,
persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label. In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most
informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.
by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery,
something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying
that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. Because disparate exposure to pollution appears, the mechanism must be unique, so informational asymmetries in housing search can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. it prevents disparate exposure to pollution from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control informational asymmetries in housing search
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if quasi-experimental policy evaluation produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once disparate exposure to pollution is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | audit studies in housing markets | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | mobility constraints across space | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | zoning rules and land-use regulation | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices
   B. It proves school-quality gradients is unique.
   C. It makes zoning rules and land-use regulation irrelevant.
   D. Shifts the baseline

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. path dependence from historical redlining alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. spatial autocorrelation analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. wealth accumulation gaps specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away informational asymmetries in housing search, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving longitudinal panel data.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when informational asymmetries in housing search can mimic school-quality gradients.
   D. The author treats European migrant neighborhoods as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates credit market discrimination.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in large U.S. metropolitan areas and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on spatial autocorrelation analysis simple.

6. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. a recipe for bread fermentation
   B. longitudinal panel data
   C. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   D. wealth accumulation gaps

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because disparate exposure to pollution uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that informational asymmetries in housing search is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using audit studies in housing markets are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like informational asymmetries in housing search make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting audit studies in housing markets as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats audit studies in housing markets as a historical curiosity and does not discuss disparate exposure to pollution or informational asymmetries in housing search. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that disparate exposure to pollution is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how informational asymmetries in housing search can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from European migrant neighborhoods. Finally, it maintains that tests combining audit studies in housing markets with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This point matters because the simplest interpretation often survives only by silently restricting the range of cases under discussion.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'spatial stratification in cities' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   B. The author argues that longitudinal panel data should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal panel data constrains credit market discrimination
   D. The discussion suggests that credit market discrimination is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **robust** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Provided that one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—disparate exposure to pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   B. strong and reliable
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like spatial autocorrelation analysis are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because path dependence from historical redlining dominates all evidence
