Passage 0054: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 711)

Under expanded parameter sweeps, the analysis suggests researchers have treated selectivity
shifts as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Even though
surface microscopy can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, a move that forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Granted that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how facet dependence
can shift baselines, altering whether selectivity shifts is even comparable across cases,
something that means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation. Should facet
dependence is changed while the nominal driver remains constant be true, one should expect
different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis
on pt is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on facet dependence, the key question
becomes whether many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces as a
single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized selectivity shifts as a
signature is easy to measure, later work asked whether the same signature survives when
protocols and baselines differ is harder to interpret without assumptions. this shift
mattered for how evidence from automotive catalytic converters was generalized because, as
the author notes, local conditions can change which processes generate selectivity shifts.

Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet dependence was the field
forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which surface microscopy constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. To be sure, a single
case can be dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only when analysts began combining surface microscopy with cross-site comparisons did claims
about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped relying on a single figure and
started relying on falsifiable predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break
degeneracies in which selectivity shifts could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like facet dependence often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which
helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of heterogeneous
catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. [A] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded.
If one wishes to move from description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then
the same observation—selectivity shifts—must be paired with tests that change the conditions
under which it appears. [B] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as
evidence. Whereas popular summaries treat selectivity shifts as an endpoint, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. [C] This
becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. [D] The author notes
that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. In this sense, metal-
surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even if the temptation to
treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which
selectivity shifts is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through
habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving DFT surface modeling.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when support interactions can mimic selectivity shifts.
   C. The passage suggests that selectivity shifts is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author treats laboratory single-crystal studies as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In other words, the disagreement is not about whether the data exist, but about what the data are evidence for.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The discussion suggests that facet dependence is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where temperature-programmed desorption constrains facet dependence
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'Pt-active-site chemistry' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   D. The passage implies that electrochemical interfaces is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **preliminary** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet dependence was the field forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because adsorbate coverage effects dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like in situ spectroscopy are needed
   C. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   D. early

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | microkinetic modeling | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | poisoning by CO | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | catalyst deactivation | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. May not generalize across contexts
   B. Can vary across epochs
   C. Shifts the baseline
   D. It proves rate enhancement is unique.

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that poisoning by CO is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how support interactions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from automotive catalytic converters. Finally, it maintains that tests combining temperature-programmed desorption with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   B. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because poisoning by CO uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that support interactions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using temperature-programmed desorption are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats temperature-programmed desorption as a historical curiosity and does not discuss poisoning by CO or support interactions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like support interactions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting temperature-programmed desorption as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because rate enhancement uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in electrochemical interfaces and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates support interactions.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on DFT surface modeling simple.

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. Since rate enhancement is observed in laboratory single-crystal studies, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. Because rate enhancement appears, the mechanism must be unique, so support interactions can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. Because support interactions co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. it prevents rate enhancement from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control support interactions

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. poisoning by CO
   B. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   C. the price of coal in 1700
   D. temperature-programmed desorption

10. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. facet dependence alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. in situ spectroscopy as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. selectivity shifts specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
