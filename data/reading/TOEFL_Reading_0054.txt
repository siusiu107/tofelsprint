Passage 0054: Internal Waves and the Hidden Mixing That Links Ocean Layers (Oceanography)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 604)

To someone watching the sea’s surface, the ocean can appear as a single layer of moving
water. Below, however, the ocean is stratified. Warm, relatively fresh water often sits
above colder, saltier, denser water, forming layers separated by sharp gradients in density.
Because density resists vertical motion, the stratified ocean behaves, in some respects,
like a stacked fluid rather than a stirred pot. Yet nutrients and heat do move upward and
downward, and that movement is critical for climate and for marine ecosystems. A major
engine of that movement is the internal wave.

Internal waves are waves that propagate along density interfaces within the ocean rather
than at the surface. When tidal flow pushes water over a ridge or through a narrow strait,
it can displace isopycnals—surfaces of equal density—creating a slow, rolling wave that
travels through the ocean interior. The wave’s amplitude can be tens of meters, even though
the surface hardly changes. In some regions, internal tides generated at seafloor topography
radiate for hundreds of kilometers. [A] They carry energy away from where they are born, and
as that energy dissipates, it can be converted into mixing.

Mixing is not uniform. Internal waves can steepen and break, much like surface waves near a
beach, producing turbulence that stirs water across density layers. Where the ocean is
rough-bottomed or where currents shear strongly, breaking is more likely. The result is a
patchwork: quiet stratification punctuated by hotspots of turbulent overturning. These
hotspots are disproportionately important because they allow deep, nutrient-rich water to
leak upward and allow surface heat to be exported downward. Phytoplankton growth in the
sunlit layer, for example, can be limited by nitrogen or iron delivered from below. A burst
of mixing can therefore fertilize a region, altering food webs and even fisheries.

Internal waves also interact with coastlines. When an internal wave shoals onto a
continental shelf, it can compress into a packet of internal bores that push cold water
toward shore at depth. Divers sometimes experience this as a sudden chill sweeping across a
reef. Such pulses can expose organisms to rapid temperature shifts and can deliver nutrients
to coastal habitats, influencing kelp and coral growth. [B] In estuaries, internal motions
can also affect how salinity intrudes, shaping where larvae and plankton are transported.

Because internal waves are mostly invisible from above, observing them requires creative
tools. Moorings with temperature and salinity sensors can detect oscillations in density
surfaces. Autonomous gliders can profile repeatedly, mapping wave structure over time.
Satellites can sometimes infer internal tides indirectly, because surface currents induced
by internal motion create subtle roughness patterns. Numerical models, meanwhile, must
represent wave generation and breaking without explicitly resolving every turbulent eddy,
which is computationally impossible at global scales.

The climate connection is direct. The ocean’s large-scale circulation depends on how easily
deep water can return to the surface. If mixing is too weak, deep water remains isolated,
and heat and carbon can be trapped for long periods. If mixing is strong, nutrients and
carbon circulate more rapidly. Internal wave-driven turbulence is therefore a key parameter
in models of carbon uptake and sea-level rise. It is also a moving target, because changing
stratification—driven by warming and freshening—can alter where and how waves break.

In short, internal waves are the ocean’s hidden movers. [C] They transport energy through
layered water and then, by breaking, convert that energy into the mixing that links the deep
ocean to the surface. [D] The sea may look calm, but within it a slow, tidal heartbeat
continually stirs the layers that make marine life—and climate—possible.

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why mixing “hotspots” are important in a stratified ocean?
   A. They provide rare pathways for nutrients and heat to cross density layers, influencing ecosystems and climate
   B. They prevent any vertical movement from occurring anywhere else
   C. They eliminate stratification entirely across the globe
   D. They occur only at the surface and thus affect only wind waves

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as observation tools for internal waves EXCEPT:
   A. sensor moorings
   B. autonomous gliders
   C. satellite inferences from surface roughness
   D. portable X-ray fluorescence on stone tools

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author describe divers feeling a “sudden chill” on a reef?
   A. To give a concrete example of how internal bores can rapidly bring cold water shoreward
   B. To argue that reefs do not experience temperature change
   C. To show that internal waves are always dangerous to humans
   D. To claim that reefs generate internal tides by themselves

7. [Reference] In the passage, “these hotspots” refers to:
   A. localized regions where internal waves break and turbulence mixes water across density layers
   B. coastal restaurants that print new menus
   C. volcanic flows that produce obsidian
   D. patches of desert vegetation using CAM

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces stratification, explains what internal waves are and how they are generated, describes how breaking produces patchy mixing and ecological effects, then discusses observation challenges and climate implications
   B. It lists fish species by size
   C. It argues that ocean layers never mix at all
   D. It focuses only on tides at the surface

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that internal waves are “hidden movers”?
   A. They drive interior energy transport and mixing that link deep and surface layers even though they are hard to see from above
   B. They move ships by pushing directly on hulls
   C. They are identical to surface waves created by wind
   D. They are myths invented by divers

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Internal waves occur only on the surface and have no effect on ecosystems or climate.
   B. The passage explains that internal waves propagate along density layers in a stratified ocean, are generated by tides interacting with topography, and, when they break, create patchy turbulence that transports nutrients and heat, affecting coastal habitats and large-scale climate circulation, even though such waves are difficult to observe directly.
   C. Mixing is uniform everywhere in the ocean, so internal waves are irrelevant.
   D. Satellites can always see internal waves clearly because they create large surface storms.
