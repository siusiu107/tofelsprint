Passage 0054: Internal Waves and the Hidden Mixing That Links Ocean Layers (Oceanography)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 604)

To someone watching the sea’s surface, the ocean can appear as a single layer of moving
water. Below, however, the ocean is stratified. Warm, relatively fresh water often sits
above colder, saltier, denser water, forming layers separated by sharp gradients in density.
Because density resists vertical motion, the stratified ocean behaves, in some respects,
like a stacked fluid rather than a stirred pot. Yet nutrients and heat do move upward and
downward, and that movement is critical for climate and for marine ecosystems. A major
engine of that movement is the internal wave.

Internal waves are waves that propagate along density interfaces within the ocean rather
than at the surface. When tidal flow pushes water over a ridge or through a narrow strait,
it can displace isopycnals—surfaces of equal density—creating a slow, rolling wave that
travels through the ocean interior. The wave’s amplitude can be tens of meters, even though
the surface hardly changes. In some regions, internal tides generated at seafloor topography
radiate for hundreds of kilometers. [A] They carry energy away from where they are born, and
as that energy dissipates, it can be converted into mixing.

Mixing is not uniform. Internal waves can steepen and break, much like surface waves near a
beach, producing turbulence that stirs water across density layers. Where the ocean is
rough-bottomed or where currents shear strongly, breaking is more likely. The result is a
patchwork: quiet stratification punctuated by hotspots of turbulent overturning. These
hotspots are disproportionately important because they allow deep, nutrient-rich water to
leak upward and allow surface heat to be exported downward. Phytoplankton growth in the
sunlit layer, for example, can be limited by nitrogen or iron delivered from below. A burst
of mixing can therefore fertilize a region, altering food webs and even fisheries.

Internal waves also interact with coastlines. When an internal wave shoals onto a
continental shelf, it can compress into a packet of internal bores that push cold water
toward shore at depth. Divers sometimes experience this as a sudden chill sweeping across a
reef. Such pulses can expose organisms to rapid temperature shifts and can deliver nutrients
to coastal habitats, influencing kelp and coral growth. [B] In estuaries, internal motions
can also affect how salinity intrudes, shaping where larvae and plankton are transported.

Because internal waves are mostly invisible from above, observing them requires creative
tools. Moorings with temperature and salinity sensors can detect oscillations in density
surfaces. Autonomous gliders can profile repeatedly, mapping wave structure over time.
Satellites can sometimes infer internal tides indirectly, because surface currents induced
by internal motion create subtle roughness patterns. Numerical models, meanwhile, must
represent wave generation and breaking without explicitly resolving every turbulent eddy,
which is computationally impossible at global scales.

The climate connection is direct. The ocean’s large-scale circulation depends on how easily
deep water can return to the surface. If mixing is too weak, deep water remains isolated,
and heat and carbon can be trapped for long periods. If mixing is strong, nutrients and
carbon circulate more rapidly. Internal wave-driven turbulence is therefore a key parameter
in models of carbon uptake and sea-level rise. It is also a moving target, because changing
stratification—driven by warming and freshening—can alter where and how waves break.

In short, internal waves are the ocean’s hidden movers. [C] They transport energy through
layered water and then, by breaking, convert that energy into the mixing that links the deep
ocean to the surface. [D] The sea may look calm, but within it a slow, tidal heartbeat
continually stirs the layers that make marine life—and climate—possible.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: When tidal flow pushes water over a ridge or through a narrow strait, it can displace isopycnals—surfaces of equal density—creating a slow, rolling wave that travels through the ocean interior.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across surface
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of surface
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to water and ocean

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that water is often incomplete and concludes that internal cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since surface overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of ocean with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage explains internal by linking water to ocean, and it shows why surface changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   C. The passage presents ocean as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once water is observed, competing explanations for internal collapse. It treats surface as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, given the evidence cited.
   D. The passage surveys internal but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed ocean first, with water serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats surface as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how internal should change if surface is altered, instead of assuming that water has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to ocean must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in surface, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of water is enough to validate ocean for internal.
   C. The passage treats water primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over ocean are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about internal are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. The passage implies that surface mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes water effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of ocean no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain internal, especially regarding waves, especially regarding density, especially regarding internal.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of surface as a factor influencing water
   B. discussion of instrument dead time as a factor influencing water
   C. discussion of internal as a factor influencing water, for the phenomenon at issue.
   D. discussion of ocean as a factor influencing water

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: When tidal flow pushes water over a ridge or through a narrow strait, it can displace isopycnals—surfaces of equal density—creating a slow, rolling wave that travels through the ocean interior.
   A. When tidal flow pushes water over a ridge or through a narrow strait. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, as framed by the author.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   D. When tidal flow pushes water over a ridge or through a narrow strait. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of ocean guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in surface are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because water directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding internal.
   C. Because comparability prevents ocean from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold surface constant while examining water.
   D. Because once water fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and surface can be ignored without changing conclusions about internal.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | water | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | surface | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves ocean is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that internal should be read alongside surface, because water alone does not settle what ocean means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Divers sometimes experience this as a sudden chill sweeping across a reef.
   A. the idea that If mixing is too weak, deep water remains isolated, and heat and carbon can be trapped for long periods
   B. the idea that When an internal wave shoals onto a continental shelf, it can compress into a packet of internal bores that push cold water toward shore...
   C. the idea that Internal waves also interact with coastlines, as the argument develops, as framed by the author, as the argument develops, within the passage’s scope.
   D. the idea that Such pulses can expose organisms to rapid temperature shifts and can deliver nutrients to coastal habitats, influencing kelp and coral growth
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of water lead to different conclusions about internal.
   B. to show that the term internal belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of water and ocean should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses ocean, so debate over water is unnecessary noise, in the context of the passage.
