Passage 0100: Urban Heat Islands, Cool Roofs, and the Physics of City Warmth (Environmental Science)
====================================================================================================
(Word count: 612)

Cities often run warmer than their surrounding countryside, especially at night. This “urban
heat island” is not a metaphor; it is a measurable temperature difference created by how
built surfaces absorb, store, and release energy. Concrete, asphalt, and dark roofs have low
albedo, meaning they reflect little sunlight and instead convert more solar radiation into
heat. Vegetation, by contrast, cools through shade and through evapotranspiration, the
process by which water evaporating from leaves removes latent heat from the surface. When
vegetation is replaced by impermeable, dark materials, the city’s surface energy balance
shifts toward warming.

Geometry amplifies the effect. In dense neighborhoods, buildings form street canyons that
trap radiation. Sunlight can bounce between walls and pavement rather than escaping back to
the sky, and at night the longwave radiation emitted by surfaces can be absorbed and re-
emitted within the canyon, slowing cooling. Wind is also modified. Tall buildings can reduce
ventilation, limiting convective heat loss and trapping vehicle exhaust and warm air. [A]
The same structures that create economic density can therefore create thermal density.

Human activity adds heat directly. Air conditioners move heat from indoors to outdoors,
concentrating it in the street-level air. Cars, buses, and industrial equipment release
waste heat as fuel is converted to motion. In winter climates, heating systems add
additional energy to the urban atmosphere. While this anthropogenic heat is often smaller
than solar input during the day, it can be significant at night and during heat waves, when
electricity demand spikes and cooling systems work hardest.

The consequences are not only uncomfortable; they are physiological and economic. Higher
nighttime temperatures reduce the body’s ability to recover from daytime heat stress,
increasing heat-related illness risk. Electricity consumption rises as cooling demand
increases, which can overload grids and raise emissions if electricity is generated from
fossil fuels. Heat can also worsen air quality by accelerating chemical reactions that form
ground-level ozone. Thus, the heat island is both a local climate issue and a public health
issue.

Mitigation strategies target causes. “Cool roofs” use reflective coatings or light-colored
materials to increase albedo, reducing heat absorption. Green roofs add vegetation, which
cools through evapotranspiration and provides insulation. Street trees and parks introduce
shade and can reduce surface temperatures dramatically, though they require water and
maintenance. Permeable pavements can increase evaporative cooling by allowing water to
infiltrate, and urban design that improves airflow can enhance convective heat removal. [B]
These interventions differ in cost and in where they work best, because a shaded residential
street and an industrial rooftop present different thermal problems.

Trade-offs also matter. Reflective surfaces can reduce cooling demand in summer but, in cold
climates, they can slightly increase heating demand in winter. Trees cool but can also trap
pollutants in stagnant conditions if ventilation is poor, and some species emit biogenic
volatile organic compounds that can contribute to ozone under certain conditions.
Nevertheless, the broad pattern is clear: reducing absorbed solar energy and increasing
evaporative and convective losses lowers urban temperatures.

Urban heat islands remind us that climate is shaped by materials and design as well as by
latitude. [C] A city can become hotter because of choices that are mundane—roof color,
pavement type, tree cover—and those choices can be revised. [D] The challenge is to deploy
solutions at scale while accounting for local climate, water availability, and equity, since
the hottest neighborhoods are often those with the least shade and the fewest resources to
adapt.

In practice, the best interventions blend surfaces, shade, and water management, because
cities are mosaics, not uniform slabs.

   B. cities contain more basalt columns that generate heat
   C. urban areas receive more starlight during transits
   D. tree rings in cities are narrower, releasing energy

2. [Vocabulary] The word “albedo” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. the reflectivity of a surface to sunlight
   B. the moisture content of lime plaster
   C. the speed of money circulation
   D. the tendency of cones to open after fire

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: As a result, the nighttime city can cool more slowly even after the sun has set.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why heat islands can increase health risks during heat waves?
   A. Warmer nights prevent physiological recovery from daytime heat, increasing cumulative stress on the body
   B. Cities eliminate all humidity, causing dehydration instantly
   C. Heat islands reduce ozone formation by cooling chemical reactions
   D. Anthropogenic heat occurs only in winter and cannot matter in summer

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention that the hottest neighborhoods often have the least shade?
   A. To highlight equity concerns and show that heat exposure is unevenly distributed within cities
   B. To argue that shade is irrelevant because roofs dominate all temperatures
   C. To claim that parks increase ozone in every case
   D. To suggest that cool roofs are impossible to install

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following mitigation strategies are mentioned EXCEPT:
   A. cool roofs
   B. green roofs
   C. permeable pavements
   D. plasmid curing through antibiotics

7. [Reference] In the passage, “these interventions” refers to:
   A. mitigation measures such as reflective roofs, vegetation, permeable surfaces, and airflow improvements
   B. the printing of new banknotes during inflation
   C. the insertion of pigment into wet plaster
   D. the growth of kelp under urchin grazing

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains physical causes of urban warming, adds the role of human heat emissions, describes consequences, then evaluates mitigation options and trade-offs
   B. It presents only a list of city temperatures without mechanisms
   C. It argues that urban heat islands are imaginary
   D. It focuses solely on winter heating and ignores summer

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that climate is shaped by materials and design?
   A. Urban temperature depends on surface properties and urban form, so changing roofs, vegetation, and airflow can change local climate
   B. Latitude alone determines city temperatures, so design changes do nothing
   C. Only the number of cars matters; roofs and trees are irrelevant
   D. Heat islands occur only because cities are closer to the sun

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Urban heat islands are described as unavoidable because albedo cannot be changed.
   B. The passage explains urban heat islands as temperature increases caused by low-albedo materials, reduced vegetation and evapotranspiration, and urban geometry that traps radiation and limits ventilation; it notes contributions from waste heat and outlines health and energy consequences, then discusses mitigation strategies such as cool roofs, green infrastructure, and permeable surfaces while emphasizing trade-offs and equity in implementation.
   C. Heat islands are said to be beneficial because they always lower electricity demand.
   D. The passage claims that street canyons cool faster because they reflect sunlight outward.
