Passage 0100: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 747)

Against that intuitive story, the analysis suggests researchers have treated disparate
exposure to pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Even if quasi-experimental policy evaluation can make the pattern
look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from
historical redlining did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate
became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which
quasi-experimental policy evaluation constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can be dramatic, the author does
not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
In this sense, spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from
historical redlining could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] The author uses the example to separate
detection from interpretation. by comparing cases in which quasi-experimental policy
evaluation constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design
over isolated exemplars. [B] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance.
Granted that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] The author shifts from
narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. [D] This reasoning
matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.

Only when analysts began combining quasi-experimental policy evaluation with cross-site
comparisons did claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate exposure to pollution
could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like path dependence
from historical redlining often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is precisely
why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, segregation-driven
inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move
from description to explanation, then the same observation—disparate exposure to
pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint may be
convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is scientifically revealing.

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike rapidly growing Sun Belt regions. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because path
dependence from historical redlining shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. Rather than treating disparate exposure to pollution as a self-sufficient conclusion,
the passage emphasizes that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In
this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in
turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any
story is arbitrary. Despite the fact that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a
definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which disparate exposure to
pollution is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. Because credit market discrimination co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents school-quality gradients from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control credit market discrimination
   C. The passage implies that quasi-experimental policy evaluation directly measures causes, meaning confounding from credit market discrimination is impossible.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once school-quality gradients is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on audit studies in housing markets simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates informational asymmetries in housing search.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in post-industrial cities and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies one mechanism.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   B. school-quality gradients
   C. a recipe for bread fermentation
   D. longitudinal panel data

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | spatial autocorrelation analysis | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | disparate exposure to pollution | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | informational asymmetries in housing search | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It replaces longitudinal panel data with intuition.
   B. Can introduce systematic bias
   C. Can be contaminated by background variability
   D. It proves school-quality gradients is unique.

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where quasi-experimental policy evaluation constrains zoning rules and land-use regulation
   B. The author argues that quasi-experimental policy evaluation should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage treats wealth accumulation gaps as a confounder and zoning rules and land-use regulation as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The discussion suggests that zoning rules and land-use regulation is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

6. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   Sentence: What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because path dependence from historical redlining dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like quasi-experimental policy evaluation are needed
   D. early

9. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving longitudinal panel data.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when zoning rules and land-use regulation can mimic mobility constraints across space.
   C. The author treats post-industrial cities as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away zoning rules and land-use regulation, since variability is merely a measurement error.

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that informational asymmetries in housing search is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal panel data are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal panel data as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or informational asymmetries in housing search. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like informational asymmetries in housing search make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal panel data as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how informational asymmetries in housing search can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from rapidly growing Sun Belt regions. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal panel data with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
