Passage 0100: Reading Exoplanet Atmospheres Through Transmission Spectra (Astronomy)
====================================================================================
(Word count: 607)

When an exoplanet passes in front of its star, a small fraction of starlight filters through
the planet’s atmosphere before reaching a telescope. The atmosphere, if present, imprints
wavelength-dependent absorption features on the light, because molecules absorb at specific
energies. This technique—transmission spectroscopy—has turned transits into laboratories,
allowing astronomers to infer what an atmosphere is made of even when the planet itself is a
point of light.

The basic geometry is simple while the measurement is not. During transit, the planet blocks
a fixed area of the star, but at wavelengths where the atmosphere is more opaque, the
effective radius appears slightly larger, because higher-altitude layers absorb more light.
By comparing the transit depth across wavelengths, researchers build a transmission
spectrum: a curve of apparent radius versus wavelength. [A] In an ideal case, the spectrum
reveals signatures of water vapor, sodium, methane, or other constituents, each with
characteristic bands.

Reality introduces complications that are physical rather than merely technical. Atmospheric
temperature affects scale height: a hotter atmosphere is puffier, making spectral features
larger. Composition affects mean molecular weight, which also influences scale height. A
hydrogen-rich atmosphere produces more pronounced features than a heavy, metal-rich one.
Meanwhile, high-altitude aerosols can mute features by adding broad opacity, flattening the
spectrum. Because multiple parameter combinations can produce similar curves, retrieval
becomes an inverse problem: one must infer the most plausible atmospheric profile given
noisy data and imperfect models. [B] The spectrum is a set of hints, not a direct photograph
of molecules.

Instrumental and stellar effects further complicate interpretation. A star is not a uniform
lamp; spots and faculae can change the apparent transit depth in a wavelength-dependent way,
mimicking or masking atmospheric features. Instrument systematics—tiny drifts, detector
persistence, thermal changes—can imprint patterns that resemble real signals. Analysts
therefore combine careful calibration with statistical models, often using multiple transits
to average down noise and to test whether features repeat. Confidence grows when a signal
appears across independent instruments and observing campaigns.

Despite challenges, the field has moved from detection to characterization. Hot Jupiters
provided early targets because their large scale heights and frequent transits yield
stronger signals. More recently, space telescopes have begun probing smaller planets,
including sub-Neptunes whose atmospheres may be enriched in heavier molecules. For
potentially rocky worlds, the stakes are higher but the signals are smaller; even a thin
atmosphere can be difficult to separate from stellar contamination. [C] Progress therefore
depends on both better instruments and better models of stars as well as planets.

Transmission spectroscopy illustrates a broader shift in astronomy: planets are no longer
counted only as orbits and radii; they are studied as physical environments. [D] By decoding
tiny wavelength-dependent shadows, astronomers turn transits into chemical interviews with
worlds that cannot be visited.

As instruments become more stable, subtle molecules—such as methane or ammonia—move from
speculation into measurable targets.

Because retrieval is an inverse problem, two different atmospheric profiles can sometimes
fit the same spectrum nearly equally well.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: During transit, the planet blocks a fixed area of the star, but at wavelengths where the atmosphere is more opaque, the effective radius appears slightly larger, because higher-altitude layers absorb more light.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to instruments and methane
   B. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of targets
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across targets

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains molecules by linking instruments to methane, and it shows why targets changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage concedes that instruments is often incomplete and concludes that molecules cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since targets overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of methane with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage surveys molecules but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed methane first, with instruments serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats targets as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, especially regarding atmosphere.
   D. The passage presents methane as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once instruments is observed, competing explanations for molecules collapse. It treats targets as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in targets, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of instruments is enough to validate methane for molecules, in the context of the passage.
   B. The passage implies that targets mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes instruments effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of methane no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain molecules, in the context of the passage.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how molecules should change if targets is altered, instead of assuming that instruments has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to methane must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage treats instruments primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over methane are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about molecules are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of sediment provenance as a factor influencing instruments
   B. discussion of targets as a factor influencing instruments
   C. discussion of methane as a factor influencing instruments
   D. discussion of molecules as a factor influencing instruments, in the cases described.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: During transit, the planet blocks a fixed area of the star, but at wavelengths where the atmosphere is more opaque, the effective radius appears slightly larger, because higher-altitude layers absorb more light.
   A. During transit. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail, especially regarding methane.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   D. During transit. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail, as framed by the author.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents methane from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold targets constant while examining instruments.
   B. Because the presence of methane guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in targets are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because instruments directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding molecules.
   D. Because once instruments fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and targets can be ignored without changing conclusions about molecules.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | instruments | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | targets | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It proves methane is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that molecules should be read alongside targets, because instruments alone does not settle what methane means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This technique—transmission spectroscopy—has turned transits into laboratories, allowing astronomers to infer what an atmosphere is made of even when the planet itself is a point of light.
   A. the preceding claim about how instruments is interpreted in relation to methane
   B. the preceding claim that targets alone explains the outcome of molecules
   C. the preceding claim that molecules functions as a direct measurement of methane
   D. the preceding claim that instruments is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term molecules belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding atmosphere.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of instruments lead to different conclusions about molecules.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of instruments and methane should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses methane, so debate over instruments is unnecessary noise, especially regarding instruments.
