Passage 0076: LiDAR and the Rebuilt Map of the Maya Lowlands
============================================================
(Word count: 616)

For much of the twentieth century, the Maya lowlands were imagined through gaps. Dense
tropical forest covered ruins, and archaeologists, limited to what they could clear and map
on foot, often treated cities as islands separated by wilderness. The image fit a convenient
narrative: impressive ceremonial centers surrounded by small farming villages, with
populations that were high but not landscape-transforming. That picture began to change when
a tool designed for modern surveying was aimed at ancient terrain.

LiDAR—light detection and ranging—uses laser pulses emitted from an aircraft to measure
distance to the ground. Many pulses are returned from leaves, but some penetrate gaps and
reflect from trunks and soil. By combining millions of returns, analysts can construct a
“bare earth” model that digitally strips away vegetation. In Maya regions, the result has
been revelatory. Features that were nearly invisible on the ground—raised causeways,
terraces, defensive walls, and dense residential mounds—appear as subtle yet unmistakable
shapes. [A] In effect, the forest becomes transparent, and the landscape reads as an
engineered surface.

The implications are not merely cartographic; they are historical. If causeways connect many
nodes, then movement and trade were likely more integrated than once assumed. If terraces
cover hillsides, then agriculture was not simply slash-and-burn but could include intensive
soil management. Reservoirs and canals suggest that water control was central, which matters
in a region with pronounced wet and dry seasons. When these features are mapped at scale,
estimates of population density rise, and the boundary between “city” and “countryside”
blurs into a continuous mosaic of settlement.

LiDAR also forces reconsideration of Maya “collapse.” Older explanations sometimes implied
sudden abandonment driven by mysterious cultural decline. A landscape filled with terraces
and waterworks suggests a different frame: the Maya were operating large, complex systems
that required constant maintenance. If drought reduced water availability, reservoirs would
be stressed. If warfare increased, defensive investments would divert labor. If forest
clearing expanded, erosion could fill canals and reduce soil fertility. In such a system,
decline may not be a single catastrophe but a sequence of stresses that erode the capacity
to repair infrastructure. [B] Collapse, then, can be understood as a failure of upkeep in an
overextended engineered landscape.

The tool has limits. LiDAR shows form, not function. A mound could be a house platform, a
workshop, or something else, and ground verification remains essential. Moreover, because
LiDAR can be expensive, coverage is uneven, raising questions about which sites get mapped
and which remain understudied. Yet even partial surveys have shifted the debate: the Maya
lowlands were not simply punctuated by cities; they were shaped by a broad, persistent human
presence.

The most important effect may be conceptual. It reminds researchers that “nothing there” can
mean “nothing visible” rather than “nothing built.” When the canopy hides walls, it is easy
to mistake concealment for nonexistence. LiDAR changes what is visible, and what becomes
visible changes what questions feel reasonable to ask. [C] Once a causeway is seen, one must
explain who built it, how it was maintained, and why it ceased to function. [D]

Some platforms revealed rectangular reservoirs beside plazas, suggesting that water
engineering was as urban as masonry itself.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word “punctuated” is closest in meaning to:
   A. interrupted at intervals by
   B. carefully measured with instruments
   C. permanently erased from
   D. made wetter by rainfall

2. [Factual] According to the passage, what does LiDAR primarily measure to create a “bare earth” model?
   A. the distance from an aircraft to reflecting surfaces using laser pulses
   B. the chemical composition of stone buildings
   C. the age of pottery fragments through radiocarbon decay
   D. the temperature of groundwater at depth

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: What looked like empty forest can, at sufficient resolution, resolve into roads, terraces, and neighborhoods.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why LiDAR affects interpretations of Maya population density?
   A. By revealing widespread residential and agricultural features, it suggests more continuous settlement than earlier ground surveys indicated
   B. By removing vegetation physically, it makes cities grow larger over time
   C. By measuring soil chemistry, it proves that fewer people lived in the region
   D. By mapping only ceremonial centers, it lowers population estimates

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following landscape features are mentioned as becoming visible with LiDAR EXCEPT:
   A. raised causeways
   B. terraces
   C. defensive walls
   D. subduction-zone tremor epicenters

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss limitations such as LiDAR showing “form, not function”?
   A. To emphasize that aerial models still require ground verification and interpretation
   B. To argue that LiDAR is useless for archaeology
   C. To claim that Maya sites are impossible to study
   D. To suggest that function is always obvious from shape

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the result” refers to:
   A. the LiDAR-derived model that reveals hidden human-made features beneath forest canopy
   B. the economic collapse of modern cities
   C. the return of leaves after forest fires
   D. the discovery of pulsar timing residuals

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It contrasts earlier views limited by forest cover with LiDAR-based mapping, then explains historical implications for settlement and collapse, and concludes with limits and conceptual consequences
   B. It provides a biography of every archaeologist working in the lowlands
   C. It describes only the physics of lasers without archaeology
   D. It argues that the Maya lowlands were uninhabited until modern times

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that decline may be “a sequence of stresses” rather than one catastrophe?
   A. Multiple pressures—such as drought, conflict, and erosion—could gradually undermine maintenance until systems failed
   B. A single unknown event instantly erased Maya society everywhere
   C. Stress is irrelevant because infrastructure repairs itself
   D. Only cultural preference, not environment, affected outcomes

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. LiDAR is an aircraft engine technology that has no relevance to archaeology.
   B. The passage explains how LiDAR, by digitally stripping forest vegetation to reveal ground features, has transformed understanding of the Maya lowlands by exposing extensive settlement, agriculture, and infrastructure, prompting revised population and integration estimates and reframing “collapse” as the breakdown of maintenance under accumulating stresses, while noting that aerial forms still require ground interpretation.
   C. LiDAR proves that the Maya built no roads or terraces because forests are too dense.
   D. Maya decline is explained solely as sudden cultural choice unrelated to landscape engineering.
