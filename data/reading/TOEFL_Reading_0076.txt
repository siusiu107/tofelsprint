Passage 0076: LiDAR and the Rebuilt Map of the Maya Lowlands
============================================================
(Word count: 616)

For much of the twentieth century, the Maya lowlands were imagined through gaps. Dense
tropical forest covered ruins, and archaeologists, limited to what they could clear and map
on foot, often treated cities as islands separated by wilderness. The image fit a convenient
narrative: impressive ceremonial centers surrounded by small farming villages, with
populations that were high but not landscape-transforming. That picture began to change when
a tool designed for modern surveying was aimed at ancient terrain.

LiDAR—light detection and ranging—uses laser pulses emitted from an aircraft to measure
distance to the ground. Many pulses are returned from leaves, but some penetrate gaps and
reflect from trunks and soil. By combining millions of returns, analysts can construct a
“bare earth” model that digitally strips away vegetation. In Maya regions, the result has
been revelatory. Features that were nearly invisible on the ground—raised causeways,
terraces, defensive walls, and dense residential mounds—appear as subtle yet unmistakable
shapes. [A] In effect, the forest becomes transparent, and the landscape reads as an
engineered surface.

The implications are not merely cartographic; they are historical. If causeways connect many
nodes, then movement and trade were likely more integrated than once assumed. If terraces
cover hillsides, then agriculture was not simply slash-and-burn but could include intensive
soil management. Reservoirs and canals suggest that water control was central, which matters
in a region with pronounced wet and dry seasons. When these features are mapped at scale,
estimates of population density rise, and the boundary between “city” and “countryside”
blurs into a continuous mosaic of settlement.

LiDAR also forces reconsideration of Maya “collapse.” Older explanations sometimes implied
sudden abandonment driven by mysterious cultural decline. A landscape filled with terraces
and waterworks suggests a different frame: the Maya were operating large, complex systems
that required constant maintenance. If drought reduced water availability, reservoirs would
be stressed. If warfare increased, defensive investments would divert labor. If forest
clearing expanded, erosion could fill canals and reduce soil fertility. In such a system,
decline may not be a single catastrophe but a sequence of stresses that erode the capacity
to repair infrastructure. [B] Collapse, then, can be understood as a failure of upkeep in an
overextended engineered landscape.

The tool has limits. LiDAR shows form, not function. A mound could be a house platform, a
workshop, or something else, and ground verification remains essential. Moreover, because
LiDAR can be expensive, coverage is uneven, raising questions about which sites get mapped
and which remain understudied. Yet even partial surveys have shifted the debate: the Maya
lowlands were not simply punctuated by cities; they were shaped by a broad, persistent human
presence.

The most important effect may be conceptual. It reminds researchers that “nothing there” can
mean “nothing visible” rather than “nothing built.” When the canopy hides walls, it is easy
to mistake concealment for nonexistence. LiDAR changes what is visible, and what becomes
visible changes what questions feel reasonable to ask. [C] Once a causeway is seen, one must
explain who built it, how it was maintained, and why it ceased to function. [D]

Some platforms revealed rectangular reservoirs beside plazas, suggesting that water
engineering was as urban as masonry itself.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: It reminds researchers that “nothing there” can mean “nothing visible” rather than “nothing built.” When the canopy hides walls, it is easy to mistake concealment for nonexistence.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across revealed
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to water and platforms
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of revealed

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys reservoirs but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed platforms first, with water serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats revealed as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   B. The passage concedes that water is often incomplete and concludes that reservoirs cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since revealed overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of platforms with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage presents platforms as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once water is observed, competing explanations for reservoirs collapse. It treats revealed as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding revealed.
   D. The passage explains reservoirs by linking water to platforms, and it shows why revealed changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in revealed, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of water is enough to validate platforms for reservoirs.
   B. The passage treats water primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over platforms are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about reservoirs are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, especially regarding rectangular, within the passage’s scope.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how reservoirs should change if revealed is altered, instead of assuming that water has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to platforms must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage implies that revealed mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes water effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of platforms no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain reservoirs, especially regarding platforms.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of reservoirs as a factor influencing water
   B. discussion of platforms as a factor influencing water, especially regarding beside.
   C. discussion of revealed as a factor influencing water
   D. discussion of allometric scaling as a factor influencing water

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: It reminds researchers that “nothing there” can mean “nothing visible” rather than “nothing built.” When the canopy hides walls, it is easy to mistake concealment for nonexistence.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, in the setting discussed.
   B. It reminds researchers that “nothing there” can mean “nothing visible” rather than “nothing built.” When the canopy hides walls. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It reminds researchers that “nothing there” can mean “nothing visible” rather than “nothing built.” When the canopy hides walls. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding rectangular, especially regarding reservoirs.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once water fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and revealed can be ignored without changing conclusions about reservoirs.
   B. Because water directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding reservoirs.
   C. Because comparability prevents platforms from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold revealed constant while examining water.
   D. Because the presence of platforms guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in revealed are merely stylistic noise.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | water | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | revealed | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It proves platforms is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that reservoirs should be read alongside revealed, because water alone does not settle what platforms means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "these" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: When these features are mapped at scale, estimates of population density rise, and the boundary between “city” and “countryside” blurs into a continuous mosaic of settlement.
   A. the idea that [C] Once a causeway is seen, one must explain who built it, how it was maintained, and why it ceased to function
   B. the idea that LiDAR also forces reconsideration of Maya “collapse.” Older explanations sometimes implied sudden abandonment driven by mysterious cultural decline
   C. the idea that Reservoirs and canals suggest that water control was central, which matters in a region with pronounced wet and dry seasons
   D. the idea that If terraces cover hillsides, then agriculture was not simply slash-and-burn but could include intensive soil management, under the stated assumptions.
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of water and platforms should be abandoned altogether.
   B. to show that the term reservoirs belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses platforms, so debate over water is unnecessary noise, in the context of the passage.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of water lead to different conclusions about reservoirs.
