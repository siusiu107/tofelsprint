Passage 0076: LiDAR and the Rebuilt Map of the Maya Lowlands
============================================================
(Word count: 616)

For much of the twentieth century, the Maya lowlands were imagined through gaps. Dense
tropical forest covered ruins, and archaeologists, limited to what they could clear and map
on foot, often treated cities as islands separated by wilderness. The image fit a convenient
narrative: impressive ceremonial centers surrounded by small farming villages, with
populations that were high but not landscape-transforming. That picture began to change when
a tool designed for modern surveying was aimed at ancient terrain.

LiDAR—light detection and ranging—uses laser pulses emitted from an aircraft to measure
distance to the ground. Many pulses are returned from leaves, but some penetrate gaps and
reflect from trunks and soil. By combining millions of returns, analysts can construct a
“bare earth” model that digitally strips away vegetation. In Maya regions, the result has
been revelatory. Features that were nearly invisible on the ground—raised causeways,
terraces, defensive walls, and dense residential mounds—appear as subtle yet unmistakable
shapes. [A] In effect, the forest becomes transparent, and the landscape reads as an
engineered surface.

The implications are not merely cartographic; they are historical. If causeways connect many
nodes, then movement and trade were likely more integrated than once assumed. If terraces
cover hillsides, then agriculture was not simply slash-and-burn but could include intensive
soil management. Reservoirs and canals suggest that water control was central, which matters
in a region with pronounced wet and dry seasons. When these features are mapped at scale,
estimates of population density rise, and the boundary between “city” and “countryside”
blurs into a continuous mosaic of settlement.

LiDAR also forces reconsideration of Maya “collapse.” Older explanations sometimes implied
sudden abandonment driven by mysterious cultural decline. A landscape filled with terraces
and waterworks suggests a different frame: the Maya were operating large, complex systems
that required constant maintenance. If drought reduced water availability, reservoirs would
be stressed. If warfare increased, defensive investments would divert labor. If forest
clearing expanded, erosion could fill canals and reduce soil fertility. In such a system,
decline may not be a single catastrophe but a sequence of stresses that erode the capacity
to repair infrastructure. [B] Collapse, then, can be understood as a failure of upkeep in an
overextended engineered landscape.

The tool has limits. LiDAR shows form, not function. A mound could be a house platform, a
workshop, or something else, and ground verification remains essential. Moreover, because
LiDAR can be expensive, coverage is uneven, raising questions about which sites get mapped
and which remain understudied. Yet even partial surveys have shifted the debate: the Maya
lowlands were not simply punctuated by cities; they were shaped by a broad, persistent human
presence.

The most important effect may be conceptual. It reminds researchers that “nothing there” can
mean “nothing visible” rather than “nothing built.” When the canopy hides walls, it is easy
to mistake concealment for nonexistence. LiDAR changes what is visible, and what becomes
visible changes what questions feel reasonable to ask. [C] Once a causeway is seen, one must
explain who built it, how it was maintained, and why it ceased to function. [D]

Some platforms revealed rectangular reservoirs beside plazas, suggesting that water
engineering was as urban as masonry itself.

Questions
---------
1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word “punctuated” is closest in meaning to:
   A. made wetter by rainfall
   B. interrupted at intervals by that factor.
   C. carefully measured with instruments
   D. permanently erased from in sense


2. [Factual] According to the passage, what does LiDAR primarily measure to create a “bare earth” model?
   A. the distance from an aircraft to reflecting surfaces using laser pulses. This would require collapse to be the limiting factor.
   B. the distance from an aircraft to reflecting surfaces using laser pulses.
   C. the distance from an aircraft to reflecting surfaces using laser pulses. This outcome would hold even if questions stays constant.
   D. the distance from an aircraft to reflecting surfaces using laser pulses by tying the effect to platforms.


3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: What looked like empty forest can, at sufficient resolution, resolve into roads, terraces, and neighborhoods.
   A. [D]
   B. [C]
   C. [A]
   D. [B]


4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why LiDAR affects interpretations of Maya population density?
   A. By revealing widespread residential and agricultural features, it suggests more continuous settlement than later ground surveys indicated. That would make rectangular the primary constraint.
   B. By revealing widespread residential and agricultural features, it suggests more continuous settlement than earlier ground surveys indicated.
   C. By revealing widespread residential and agricultural features, it suggests more continuous settlement than earlier ground surveys indicated. This would occur only when questions dominates.
   D. By revealing widespread residential and agricultural landscape, it suggests more continuous settlement than earlier ground surveys indicated. This would occur only when causeways dominates.


5. [Negative Factual] All of the following landscape features are mentioned as becoming visible with LiDAR EXCEPT:
   A. raised causeways.
   B. subduction-zone tremor epicenters.
   C. defensive walls.
   D. terraces.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss limitations such as LiDAR showing “form, not function”?
   A. To emphasize that aerial models still require ground verification and interpretation.
   B. To emphasize that aerial models still require ground verification and interpretation by tying the effect to dense.
   C. To emphasize that aerial models still require ground verification and interpretation. This would require landscape to be the limiting factor.
   D. To emphasize that aerial models still require ground verification and interpretation. This would require features to be the limiting factor.

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It contrasts earlier views limited by forest cover with LiDAR-based mapping, then explains historical implications for settlement and landscape, and concludes with limits and conceptual consequences. That would make features the primary constraint.

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that decline may be “a sequence of stresses” rather than one catastrophe?
   A. Multiple pressures—such as drought, conflict, and erosion—could gradually undermine maintenance until systems failed by tying the effect to collapse.
   B. Multiple pressures—such as drought, conflict, and erosion—could gradually undermine maintenance until systems failed.
   C. Multiple pressures—such as drought, conflict, and erosion—could gradually undermine maintenance until systems failed. This would occur only when rectangular dominates.
