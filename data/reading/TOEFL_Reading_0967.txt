Passage 0967: Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments (Psychology)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 732)

From a cognitive-control perspective, researchers found that researchers have treated
strategy shifts over trials as the decisive sign of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory
experiments. Granted that paired-associate tasks can make the pattern look unusually sharp,
the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

What matters most is the apparent regularity of strategy shifts over trials, which is why
drives the first interpretation: strategy shifts over trials is treated as a direct readout
of mechanism. Provided that strategy shifts over trials is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway, then observations from cross-cultural replications would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. Rather than the caveat that encoding strength
heterogeneity might reproduce the same pattern, the passage emphasizes that the literature
is full of such claims. In this sense, practice-driven suppression of competing memories is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify encoding strength heterogeneity
was the field forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. [A] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather
than as an embarrassment. by comparing cases in which paired-associate tasks constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, something that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] This reasoning
matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test. While it is true that a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. [C] The author implies that replication is
informative only when protocols are comparable. [D] At first glance, the pattern seems
obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—strategy shifts over trials—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat strategy shifts over trials as an endpoint in one account, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in
another. In this sense, retrieval-based inhibition is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of retrieval-induced
forgetting in memory experiments: inference is constrained by what competing models would
also predict. Provided that one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the
same observation—strategy shifts over trials—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat strategy shifts over
trials as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated.

In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike cross-cultural
replications. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms
differed largely because encoding strength heterogeneity shifted the baseline in different
directions across sites. The issue is not treating strategy shifts over trials as a self-
sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation. In this sense, selective recall causing forgetting is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory
experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying
that any story is arbitrary. To be sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive
answer is strong, yet the result is a framework in which strategy shifts over trials is
interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. strategy shifts over trials
   B. paired-associate tasks
   C. the length of the Nile in miles
   D. Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments

2. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once metacognitive illusions is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Since metacognitive illusions is observed in cross-cultural replications, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if pre-registered replication produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. it prevents metacognitive illusions from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control test expectancy effects

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. test expectancy effects alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. recognition tests as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. metacognitive illusions specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats fMRI pattern analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss strategy shifts over trials or test expectancy effects. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage argues that selective recall causing forgetting cannot be studied empirically because confounders like test expectancy effects make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting fMRI pattern analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that retrieval-based inhibition is settled because strategy shifts over trials uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that test expectancy effects is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using fMRI pattern analysis are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments and argues that strategy shifts over trials is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how test expectancy effects can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from clinical populations. Finally, it maintains that tests combining fMRI pattern analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about practice-driven suppression of competing memories robust.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **preliminary** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Rather than the caveat that encoding strength heterogeneity might reproduce the same pattern, the passage emphasizes that the literature is full of such claims.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because encoding strength heterogeneity dominates all evidence
   B. early
   C. irrelevant to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like recognition tests are needed

6. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | recognition tests | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | strategy shifts over trials | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | encoding strength heterogeneity | Changes the apparent slope |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Can be degenerate with another effect
   B. It makes encoding strength heterogeneity irrelevant.
   C. Changes the apparent slope
   D. It proves context-dependent effects is unique.

7. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away stress modulation of recall, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving recognition tests.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when stress modulation of recall can mimic metacognitive illusions.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using recognition tests.

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The passage underscores that transparency about priors can be more informative than presenting one visually impressive fit.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because context-dependent effects uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on paired-associate tasks simple.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates test expectancy effects.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in clinical populations and everywhere else.

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'practice-driven suppression of competing memories' refers to a different field altogether, not to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments.
   B. The passage implies that cross-cultural replications is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author argues that pre-registered replication should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where pre-registered replication constrains inhibitory control differences
