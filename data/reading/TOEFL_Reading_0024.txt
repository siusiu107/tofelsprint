Passage 0024: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 762)

From a cognitive-control perspective, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated selective memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization. Admittedly, longitudinal attitude
surveys can make the pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that
such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting
debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which is
precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives. If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the
passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to
move from description to explanation, then the same observation—selective memory for
supporting evidence—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears cannot be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory
for supporting evidence as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting
point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under
replication. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. It is the apparent regularity of selective memory for
supporting evidence that drives the first interpretation: selective memory for supporting
evidence is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. Unless selective memory for supporting
evidence is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then observations from cross-national
survey samples would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical cannot be
claimed with confidence. Not the caveat that cultural norms about consistency might
reproduce the same pattern, but the literature is full of such claims. While it is true that
the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that uniqueness is
precisely what must be shown, not assumed. [A] This reasoning matters because it changes
what counts as a decisive test. it highlights how cultural norms about consistency can shift
baselines, altering whether selective memory for supporting evidence is even comparable
across cases, an outcome that means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation.
[B] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. If cultural norms about consistency is
changed while the nominal driver remains constant is granted, one should expect different
outcomes when conditions are perturbed. [C] The discussion makes clear that measurement
choices can masquerade as mechanism. [D] The passage highlights that mechanism claims must
survive out-of-sample checks. Using longitudinal attitude surveys under stable conditions,
the key question becomes whether one frequently cited case from cross-national survey
samples appeared to support the direct-readout view. Even if the original fit looked
visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in cultural norms
about consistency altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic selective memory for
supporting evidence. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which illustrates why
boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. In this sense,
dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label. Rarely has it been the case that claims about cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions, at least before analysts began combining longitudinal attitude
surveys with cross-site comparisons. the goal was to break degeneracies in which selective
memory for supporting evidence could be explained in more than one way largely because
confounders like cultural norms about consistency often co-vary with the driver. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. Only by analysts
began combining longitudinal attitude surveys with cross-site comparisons was the field
forced to accept that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which selective memory for supporting evidence could be
explained in more than one way because confounders like cultural norms about consistency
often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, self-justification
mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the
end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the
evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifted confidence judgments is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control self-concept threat
   C. Since shifted confidence judgments is observed in cross-national survey samples, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because shifted confidence judgments appears, the mechanism must be unique, so self-concept threat can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [B] Later comparisons reveal why this matters.
   A. unclear
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like behavioral priming designs are needed
   C. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. behavioral priming designs as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. self-concept threat alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. shifted confidence judgments specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using meta-analytic synthesis are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting meta-analytic synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats meta-analytic synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifted confidence judgments or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that shifted confidence judgments is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-national survey samples. Finally, it maintains that tests combining meta-analytic synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.

5. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. behavioral priming designs
   B. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   C. selective memory for supporting evidence
   D. the price of coal in 1700

6. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when cultural norms about consistency can mimic selective memory for supporting evidence.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving meta-analytic synthesis.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away cultural norms about consistency, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using meta-analytic synthesis.

7. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where behavioral priming designs constrains self-concept threat
   B. The passage implies that workplace decision settings is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The discussion suggests that self-concept threat is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The author argues that behavioral priming designs should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: it highlights how cultural norms about consistency can shift baselines, altering whether selective memory for supporting evidence is even comparable across cases, an outcome that means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on choice-induced preference paradigms simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
