Passage 0024: C4 Photosynthesis as a Biochemical Response to Heat and Drought (Botany)
======================================================================================
(Word count: 637)

Photosynthesis is often summarized as plants “turning sunlight into sugar,” but the chemical
path from light to biomass is shaped by a persistent complication: the enzyme that captures
carbon dioxide can also capture oxygen. In most plants, the enzyme RuBisCO fixes carbon
dioxide in a cycle known as C3 photosynthesis. RuBisCO, however, is not perfectly selective.
When it binds oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, it triggers photorespiration, a process that
consumes energy and releases previously fixed carbon. Photorespiration is not a minor
inefficiency; under hot, dry conditions it can drain a significant fraction of the plant’s
potential productivity.

C4 photosynthesis evolved as a biochemical workaround. Instead of relying on RuBisCO alone
in the same cells where air enters, C4 plants first capture carbon dioxide into a four-
carbon compound using a different enzyme that does not react with oxygen. They then deliver
that compound to specialized bundle-sheath cells, where carbon dioxide is released at high
concentration around RuBisCO. By raising the local carbon dioxide level, C4 plants suppress
photorespiration: RuBisCO is fed what it is meant to bind. The plant is, in effect, paying
an energetic cost to run a carbon concentrating system in order to avoid a larger cost
later.

This design interacts with climate through water. When stomata—the pores that admit carbon
dioxide—open, water vapor escapes. In hot or arid environments, plants may partially close
stomata to conserve water, but closing stomata lowers internal carbon dioxide, which makes
photorespiration more likely in C3 plants. [A] Because C4 plants can concentrate carbon
dioxide internally, they can maintain carbon fixation even when stomata are less open,
improving water-use efficiency. This is why many C4 grasses dominate warm savannas and
tropical grasslands.

The trade-off is that the concentrating machinery costs ATP, so in cool, moist, and shaded
environments, C3 plants can outcompete C4 plants because the photorespiration penalty is
smaller and the extra C4 steps are not worth paying for. Temperature and carbon dioxide
levels both matter. When atmospheric carbon dioxide is high, C3 plants suffer less from
photorespiration because RuBisCO encounters carbon dioxide more often. When carbon dioxide
is low, C4 advantages grow. This is one reason paleobotanists link the expansion of C4
grasslands in Earth’s past to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and to the spread of
open habitats.

Agricultural consequences follow. Maize and sugarcane are C4 crops and often yield well in
hot climates, while rice and wheat are C3 crops and can be more sensitive to heat stress
that increases photorespiration. Yet crops are not locked into a single destiny. Breeding
can improve heat tolerance, and irrigation can reduce water stress, altering the relative
advantages. Moreover, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide could, in principle, benefit C3
crops by reducing photorespiration, though heat waves and drought can offset that benefit.
[B] The net outcome depends on how multiple drivers combine on plant physiology and on farm
practices.

A useful fingerprint of these pathways appears in carbon isotopes. Because enzymes
discriminate slightly between carbon isotopes, C3 and C4 plants leave different ratios of
carbon‑13 to carbon‑12 in their tissues. Ecologists can measure these ratios in soil organic
matter or in the enamel of grazing animals to infer which photosynthetic strategy dominated
an ancient landscape. In modern settings, isotope maps help track how grasslands respond to
warming or to shifts in rainfall, linking leaf-level chemistry to regional change.

The deeper lesson is that photosynthesis is not one universal recipe. It is a family of
strategies shaped by oxygen, temperature, and water availability. [C] By building a
biochemical pump, C4 plants changed the terms of the carbon-oxygen competition inside their
leaves. The result is visible at continental scale: grasslands where C4 species thrive,
forests where C3 species dominate, and cropping systems that reflect the hidden chemistry of
a single enzyme’s preferences. [D]
