Passage 0024: C4 Photosynthesis as a Biochemical Response to Heat and Drought (Botany)
======================================================================================
(Word count: 637)

Photosynthesis is often summarized as plants “turning sunlight into sugar,” but the chemical
path from light to biomass is shaped by a persistent complication: the enzyme that captures
carbon dioxide can also capture oxygen. In most plants, the enzyme RuBisCO fixes carbon
dioxide in a cycle known as C3 photosynthesis. RuBisCO, however, is not perfectly selective.
When it binds oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, it triggers photorespiration, a process that
consumes energy and releases previously fixed carbon. Photorespiration is not a minor
inefficiency; under hot, dry conditions it can drain a significant fraction of the plant’s
potential productivity.

C4 photosynthesis evolved as a biochemical workaround. Instead of relying on RuBisCO alone
in the same cells where air enters, C4 plants first capture carbon dioxide into a four-
carbon compound using a different enzyme that does not react with oxygen. They then deliver
that compound to specialized bundle-sheath cells, where carbon dioxide is released at high
concentration around RuBisCO. By raising the local carbon dioxide level, C4 plants suppress
photorespiration: RuBisCO is fed what it is meant to bind. The plant is, in effect, paying
an energetic cost to run a carbon concentrating system in order to avoid a larger cost
later.

This design interacts with climate through water. When stomata—the pores that admit carbon
dioxide—open, water vapor escapes. In hot or arid environments, plants may partially close
stomata to conserve water, but closing stomata lowers internal carbon dioxide, which makes
photorespiration more likely in C3 plants. [A] Because C4 plants can concentrate carbon
dioxide internally, they can maintain carbon fixation even when stomata are less open,
improving water-use efficiency. This is why many C4 grasses dominate warm savannas and
tropical grasslands.

The trade-off is that the concentrating machinery costs ATP, so in cool, moist, and shaded
environments, C3 plants can outcompete C4 plants because the photorespiration penalty is
smaller and the extra C4 steps are not worth paying for. Temperature and carbon dioxide
levels both matter. When atmospheric carbon dioxide is high, C3 plants suffer less from
photorespiration because RuBisCO encounters carbon dioxide more often. When carbon dioxide
is low, C4 advantages grow. This is one reason paleobotanists link the expansion of C4
grasslands in Earth’s past to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and to the spread of
open habitats.

Agricultural consequences follow. Maize and sugarcane are C4 crops and often yield well in
hot climates, while rice and wheat are C3 crops and can be more sensitive to heat stress
that increases photorespiration. Yet crops are not locked into a single destiny. Breeding
can improve heat tolerance, and irrigation can reduce water stress, altering the relative
advantages. Moreover, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide could, in principle, benefit C3
crops by reducing photorespiration, though heat waves and drought can offset that benefit.
[B] The net outcome depends on how multiple drivers combine on plant physiology and on farm
practices.

A useful fingerprint of these pathways appears in carbon isotopes. Because enzymes
discriminate slightly between carbon isotopes, C3 and C4 plants leave different ratios of
carbon‑13 to carbon‑12 in their tissues. Ecologists can measure these ratios in soil organic
matter or in the enamel of grazing animals to infer which photosynthetic strategy dominated
an ancient landscape. In modern settings, isotope maps help track how grasslands respond to
warming or to shifts in rainfall, linking leaf-level chemistry to regional change.

The deeper lesson is that photosynthesis is not one universal recipe. It is a family of
strategies shaped by oxygen, temperature, and water availability. [C] By building a
biochemical pump, C4 plants changed the terms of the carbon-oxygen competition inside their
leaves. The result is visible at continental scale: grasslands where C4 species thrive,
forests where C3 species dominate, and cropping systems that reflect the hidden chemistry of
a single enzyme’s preferences. [D]

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The trade-off is that the concentrating machinery costs ATP, so in cool, moist, and shaded environments, C3 plants can outcompete C4 plants because the photorespiration penalty is smaller and the extra C4 steps are not worth paying for.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to dioxide and plants
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across photorespiration
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of photorespiration
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that dioxide is often incomplete and concludes that carbon cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since photorespiration overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of plants with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage surveys carbon but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed plants first, with dioxide serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats photorespiration as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, especially regarding water.
   C. The passage presents plants as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once dioxide is observed, competing explanations for carbon collapse. It treats photorespiration as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   D. The passage explains carbon by linking dioxide to plants, and it shows why photorespiration changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in photorespiration, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of dioxide is enough to validate plants for carbon.
   B. The passage implies that photorespiration mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes dioxide effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of plants no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain carbon, especially regarding rubisco, especially regarding plants, in the setting discussed.
   C. The passage treats dioxide primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over plants are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about carbon are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how carbon should change if photorespiration is altered, instead of assuming that dioxide has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to plants must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of carbon as a factor influencing dioxide
   B. discussion of photorespiration as a factor influencing dioxide
   C. discussion of thermal hysteresis as a factor influencing dioxide
   D. discussion of plants as a factor influencing dioxide, in the context of the passage.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: The trade-off is that the concentrating machinery costs ATP, so in cool, moist, and shaded environments, C3 plants can outcompete C4 plants because the photorespiration penalty is smaller and the extra C4 steps are not worth paying for.
   A. The trade-off is that the concentrating machinery costs ATP. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   D. The trade-off is that the concentrating machinery costs ATP. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once dioxide fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and photorespiration can be ignored without changing conclusions about carbon.
   B. Because the presence of plants guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in photorespiration are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because dioxide directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding carbon.
   D. Because comparability prevents plants from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold photorespiration constant while examining dioxide.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | dioxide | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | photorespiration | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves plants is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that carbon should be read alongside photorespiration, because dioxide alone does not settle what plants means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This design interacts with climate through water.
   A. the preceding claim about how dioxide is interpreted in relation to plants
   B. the preceding claim that dioxide is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   C. the preceding claim that carbon functions as a direct measurement of plants
   D. the preceding claim that photorespiration alone explains the outcome of carbon

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses plants, so debate over dioxide is unnecessary noise, especially regarding photorespiration, especially regarding dioxide.
   B. to show that the term carbon belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of dioxide and plants should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of dioxide lead to different conclusions about carbon.
