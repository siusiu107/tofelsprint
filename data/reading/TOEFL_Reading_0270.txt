Passage 0270: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 634)

In replication efforts, one sees why researchers have treated increased liking for chosen
options as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization. To
be sure, implicit association tests can make the pattern look unusually sharp, yet the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

If anything is responsible, it is the apparent regularity of increased liking for chosen
options, and therefore drives the first interpretation: increased liking for chosen options
is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. [A] The author uses the detour to show why a
different metric would lead to a different conclusion. If increased liking for chosen
options is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then observations from cross-national
survey samples would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. [B] Later
comparisons reveal why this matters. The issue is not the caveat that measurement reactivity
might reproduce the same pattern; it is that the literature is full of such claims. [C] The
author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. [D]
The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. In this
sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity
occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which implicit association tests constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike cross-national survey samples. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because
measurement reactivity shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. the author
therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating increased liking for
chosen options as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ. In this
sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—increased liking for chosen
options—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas
popular summaries treat increased liking for chosen options as an endpoint may be
convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. In this sense, self-justification
mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why
the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
While it is true that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong,
the result is a framework in which increased liking for chosen options is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates public versus private commitment.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on meta-analytic synthesis simple.

2. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away public versus private commitment, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. The passage suggests that shifted confidence judgments is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving longitudinal attitude surveys.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic shifted confidence judgments.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. devaluation of rejected alternatives
   B. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   C. a list of Olympic medal counts
   D. choice-induced preference paradigms

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like meta-analytic synthesis are needed
   B. important
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: If anything is responsible, it is the apparent regularity of increased liking for chosen options, and therefore drives the first interpretation: increased liking for chosen options is treated as a direct readout of mechanism.
   A. choice-induced preference paradigms as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. cultural norms about consistency alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing theories?
   A. The discussion suggests that self-concept threat is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'attitude reconfiguration following commitment' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   C. The author argues that longitudinal attitude surveys should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal attitude surveys constrains self-concept threat

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | behavioral priming designs | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | increased liking for chosen options | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | measurement reactivity | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Can be degenerate with another effect
   B. It proves selective memory for supporting evidence is unique.
   C. Shifts the baseline
   D. It replaces implicit association tests with intuition.

8. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. Because shifted confidence judgments appears, the mechanism must be unique, so measurement reactivity can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. The passage implies that implicit association tests directly measures causes, meaning confounding from measurement reactivity is impossible.
   C. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity
   D. Since shifted confidence judgments is observed in workplace decision settings, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the inference is underdetermined, the most informative tests are those that break degeneracies rather than those that merely sharpen one feature.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that shifted confidence judgments is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining implicit association tests with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats implicit association tests as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifted confidence judgments or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting implicit association tests as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using implicit association tests are unnecessary.
