Passage 0973: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 773)

Despite apparently clean spectra, researchers have treated rotation-modulated light curves
as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy. Admittedly,
spot–facular forward modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than
rely on familiar narratives. Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify
limb-darkening model mismatch was the field forced to accept that the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which
spot–facular forward modeling constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In
this sense, unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. Not the obvious explanation but methodological
humility is what the passage presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one
wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—rotation-modulated
light curves—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat rotation-modulated light curves as an endpoint invites a
tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. The decisive factor is the
apparent regularity of rotation-modulated light curves; once that is stated, drives the
first interpretation: rotation-modulated light curves is treated as a direct readout of
mechanism. Unless rotation-modulated light curves is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway, then observations from bright nearby planet hosts would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical cannot be claimed with confidence. Not the caveat
that limb-darkening model mismatch might reproduce the same pattern, but the literature is
full of such claims. It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson
of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what competing
models would also predict. [A] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured
with what is inferred. Were one wishes to move from description to explanation to fail, then
the same observation—rotation-modulated light curves—must be paired with tests that change
the conditions under which it appears. [B] The discussion treats exceptions as informative,
not as errors to be discarded. Whereas popular summaries treat rotation-modulated light
curves as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. [C] This
is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. [D] The
author suggests that the same evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ. In
this sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label. In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated
more precisely: the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in
settings unlike bright nearby planet hosts. the same summary statistic could be reproduced
while the underlying mechanisms differed in part because limb-darkening model mismatch
shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. Not treating rotation-modulated
light curves as a self-sufficient conclusion, but the author therefore separates detection
from interpretation. Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify limb-
darkening model mismatch did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which spot–facular forward modeling constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces
analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. Granted that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense,
photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, researchers found that the passage
concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing
assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without
implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that limb-darkening model mismatch is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using Gaussian-process detrending are unnecessary.
   B. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how limb-darkening model mismatch can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from active K-dwarf host stars. Finally, it maintains that tests combining Gaussian-process detrending with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats Gaussian-process detrending as a historical curiosity and does not discuss apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering or limb-darkening model mismatch. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like limb-darkening model mismatch make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting Gaussian-process detrending as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

2. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when starspot temperature contrasts can mimic rotation-modulated light curves.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using multi-epoch transit campaigns.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving multi-epoch transit campaigns.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away starspot temperature contrasts, since variability is merely a measurement error.

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **convergent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify limb-darkening model mismatch did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like spot–facular forward modeling are needed
   B. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail
   C. coming together

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because spurious molecular detections uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in M-dwarf systems with repeated transits and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on spot–facular forward modeling simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates instrument drift across visits.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | Gaussian-process detrending | Depends on modeling priors |

   B. Depends on modeling priors
   C. It proves spurious molecular detections is unique.
   D. Co-varies with the driver of interest

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that chromatic transit analysis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from instrument drift across visits is impossible.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once spurious molecular detections is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. it prevents spurious molecular detections from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control instrument drift across visits

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The passage treats apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as a confounder and instrument drift across visits as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
   C. The passage implies that active K-dwarf host stars is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where simultaneous photometric monitoring constrains instrument drift across visits
