Passage 0919: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 751)

Despite the appeal of a single mechanism, the central disagreement can be stated more
precisely: researchers have treated transient surface deformation as the decisive sign of
subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip. While it is true that numerical
rupture simulations can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn,
forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike the Cascadia subduction zone. [A] The
argument hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because stress
transfer after large events shifted the baseline in different directions across sites, which
is why replication matters. [B] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric
would lead to a different conclusion. the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation—not treating transient surface deformation as a self-sufficient conclusion.
[C] The author suggests that the same evidence can support multiple stories when priors
differ. [D] The author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen
case. In this sense, megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike the Cascadia
subduction zone. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying
mechanisms differed because stress transfer after large events shifted the baseline in
different directions across sites. The issue is not treating transient surface deformation
as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—transient surface deformation—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat transient surface deformation as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder
to interpret without assumptions. In this sense, episodic tremor and slip is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify stress
transfer after large events. by comparing cases in which numerical rupture simulations
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an
outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. While
it is true that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Not until analysts began combining numerical rupture simulations with cross-site comparisons
was it clear that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. The passage
argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which transient surface deformation could
be explained in more than one way because confounders like stress transfer after large
events often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became
an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit that
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, slow-slip events on
plate interfaces is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. To be sure,
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, yet the result is a
framework in which transient surface deformation is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that inversion of seismic waveforms directly measures causes, meaning confounding from stress transfer after large events is impossible.
   B. Because tsunami-generating seafloor uplift appears, the mechanism must be unique, so stress transfer after large events can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. it prevents tsunami-generating seafloor uplift from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control stress transfer after large events

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where continuous GPS geodesy constrains fluid overpressure in faults
   B. The discussion suggests that fluid overpressure in faults is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'slow-slip events on plate interfaces' refers to a different field altogether, not to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip.
   D. The passage implies that Sumatra–Andaman is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conspicuous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because stress transfer after large events shifted the baseline in different directions across sites.
   A. irrelevant to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip, serving only as background detail
   B. easy to notice
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like continuous GPS geodesy are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because stress transfer after large events dominates all evidence

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how locked versus creeping patches can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Chilean margin. Finally, it maintains that tests combining numerical rupture simulations with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   B. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because tsunami-generating seafloor uplift uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that locked versus creeping patches is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using numerical rupture simulations are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like locked versus creeping patches make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting numerical rupture simulations as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats numerical rupture simulations as a historical curiosity and does not discuss tsunami-generating seafloor uplift or locked versus creeping patches. It ends without any methodological implication.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on paleoseismic trenching simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates locked versus creeping patches.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Chilean margin and everywhere else.

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: While it is true that numerical rupture simulations can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions.
