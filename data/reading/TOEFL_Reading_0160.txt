Passage 0160: Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments (Psychology)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 743)

In classic laboratory tasks, the passage argues that researchers have treated strategy
shifts over trials as the decisive sign of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory
experiments. Even though paired-associate tasks can make the pattern look unusually sharp,
the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives.

Seldom, prior to analysts began combining paired-associate tasks with cross-site
comparisons, did investigators concede that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in
memory experiments stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which strategy shifts over trials could
be explained in more than one way because confounders like test expectancy effects often co-
vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable. In this sense, practice-driven suppression of competing memories is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. [A] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. If
one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—strategy
shifts over trials—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. [B] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot
rule out. Whereas popular summaries treat strategy shifts over trials as an endpoint looks
decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. [C] The discussion treats
exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. [D] This reasoning matters because
it changes what counts as a decisive test.

Even if the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how test expectancy
effects can shift baselines, altering whether strategy shifts over trials is even comparable
across cases, a move that means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation.
Should test expectancy effects is changed while the nominal driver remains constant be true,
one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In this sense,
retrieval-based inhibition is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on test expectancy effects, the passage
suggests many early studies framed retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments as a
single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized strategy shifts over trials as
a signature is easy to measure, later work asked whether the same signature survives when
protocols and baselines differ is harder to interpret without assumptions. this shift
mattered for how evidence from laboratory paradigms was generalized because, as the author
notes, local conditions can change which processes generate strategy shifts over trials.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify test expectancy effects did
the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which paired-associate tasks
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample,
which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. While it is true that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this
sense, selective recall causing forgetting is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to
admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary. Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is
strong, the result is a framework in which strategy shifts over trials is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. inhibitory control differences alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. process-dissociation procedures as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. context-dependent effects specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | fMRI pattern analysis | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | metacognitive illusions | May be muted by other processes |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Samples only part of the system
   B. May be muted by other processes
   C. It replaces paired-associate tasks with intuition.
   D. Can mimic the target feature

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **approximate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Should test expectancy effects is changed while the nominal driver remains constant be true, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because encoding strength heterogeneity dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like pre-registered replication are needed
   C. irrelevant to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments, serving only as background detail
   D. rough

4. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize model assumptions?
   A. The passage implies that fMRI pattern analysis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from inhibitory control differences is impossible.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if fMRI pattern analysis produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. it prevents metacognitive illusions from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control inhibitory control differences
   D. Because inhibitory control differences co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The passage treats strategy shifts over trials as a confounder and inhibitory control differences as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The author argues that pre-registered replication should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where pre-registered replication constrains inhibitory control differences
   D. The passage implies that cross-cultural replications is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

6. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the author’s favorite color
   B. fMRI pattern analysis
   C. reduced recall of unpracticed items
   D. Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats pre-registered replication as a historical curiosity and does not discuss context-dependent effects or encoding strength heterogeneity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage argues that selective recall causing forgetting cannot be studied empirically because confounders like encoding strength heterogeneity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting pre-registered replication as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that retrieval-based inhibition is settled because context-dependent effects uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that encoding strength heterogeneity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using pre-registered replication are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments and argues that context-dependent effects is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how encoding strength heterogeneity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-cultural replications. Finally, it maintains that tests combining pre-registered replication with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about practice-driven suppression of competing memories robust.

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because context-dependent effects uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on paired-associate tasks simple.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates stress modulation of recall.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in classroom study settings and everywhere else.

9. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that strategy shifts over trials is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when inhibitory control differences can mimic strategy shifts over trials.
