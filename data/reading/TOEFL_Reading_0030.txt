Passage 0030: Activated Sludge as Engineered Microbial Work in Wastewater Treatment (Engineering)
=================================================================================================
(Word count: 610)

A city’s wastewater looks like a uniform gray stream, but it is chemically and biologically
diverse: food scraps, detergents, human waste, industrial residues, and storm runoff are
mixed into a single flow. Treating that flow is not only about removing visible solids; it
is about removing dissolved organic matter and nutrients that would otherwise deplete oxygen
in rivers or trigger algal blooms in lakes. One of the most widely used approaches is the
activated sludge process, in which microbes are cultivated deliberately to consume
pollutants before the water is released.

The core idea is to turn a treatment tank into an ecosystem with a controlled food supply.
Wastewater enters an aeration basin where air is bubbled through the liquid. The oxygen
supports aerobic bacteria that metabolize dissolved organic compounds, converting them into
new biomass, carbon dioxide, and water. As microbes grow, they form flocs—clumps of cells
and extracellular material—that can settle. After aeration, the mixture flows to a clarifier
where flocs sink, producing clearer water above. [A] The settled biomass is not discarded
immediately. A portion is returned to the aeration basin as “return activated sludge,”
seeding the next round with a concentrated microbial community.

This recycling is essential for stability. If biomass were not returned, microbes would wash
out faster than they could grow, and treatment would fail. By controlling the return rate
and the amount of sludge wasted from the system, operators control the sludge age—the
average time microbes remain in the plant. Sludge age, in turn, shapes which organisms
dominate. Fast-growing bacteria that remove carbon can thrive at low sludge age, while
slower-growing nitrifying bacteria that convert ammonia to nitrate require longer sludge
ages to establish. The process therefore links a physical control knob to a biological
outcome.

Nutrient removal illustrates the same coupling. Ammonia from waste can be toxic and can
contribute to oxygen demand in receiving waters. Nitrification converts ammonia to nitrate
in aerobic zones. To remove nitrogen fully, many plants add an anoxic zone where different
bacteria reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas, which escapes harmlessly to the atmosphere. This
denitrification requires a carbon source and low oxygen. Operators can create the needed
conditions by staging tanks or by recycling nitrate-rich water into zones where oxygen is
limited. [B] The result is a choreography of microbes that perform different reactions in
different habitats, all within one facility.

The activated sludge system is sensitive to shock. A sudden toxic discharge can kill key
microbes, reducing removal efficiency. A heavy storm can dilute wastewater and change flow
rates, washing biomass into the clarifier. Even ordinary temperature shifts matter, because
microbial metabolism slows in cold water. Operators respond by adjusting aeration, return
rates, and chemical additions, but the system’s resilience has limits. Good treatment is
therefore partly design and partly operation: tanks must be sized for variability, and
monitoring must detect when biology is drifting.

Energy is a major cost, because aeration requires electricity. Yet aeration cannot be
minimized blindly. If oxygen is too low, bacteria may form filaments that cause poor
settling, producing cloudy effluent. If oxygen is too high, energy is wasted and
denitrification zones may be harder to maintain. Balancing oxygen is thus both an economic
and a biological task. [C]

Activated sludge is, in essence, applied ecology. [D] It relies on steering microbial
communities with flows, oxygen, and time so that what would be pollution becomes food for
organisms that then become settleable biomass. The treated water’s clarity is the visible
endpoint of an invisible work force, and the plant’s success depends on respecting that work
force as living chemistry rather than as a simple mechanical filter.


Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, why is some settled biomass returned to the aeration basin?
   A. To keep a concentrated microbial community in the system so microbes do not wash out
   B. To increase wastewater toxicity so bacteria evolve
   C. To prevent any settling from occurring
   D. To replace the need for oxygen in the basin

2. [Vocabulary] The word “clarifier” in the passage most nearly refers to:
   A. a tank where microbial flocs settle and clearer water separates above
   B. a device that adds detergent to wastewater
   C. a pipe that increases storm runoff
   D. a chemical that kills bacteria

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Without that return stream, the community would be continually diluted until it could not keep up with incoming waste.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why sludge age influences nitrification?
   A. Nitrifying bacteria grow more slowly, so they need longer residence time to persist in the plant
   B. Nitrifiers require complete absence of oxygen
   C. Nitrifiers are removed by settling and cannot live in flocs
   D. Sludge age affects only pipes and not biology

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author describe denitrification zones?
   A. To show that different microbial reactions require different oxygen conditions that plants create through staged habitats
   B. To argue that nitrogen removal happens only by filtering solids
   C. To claim that nitrate cannot be transformed biologically
   D. To suggest that anoxic zones are accidental and uncontrolled

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as potential shocks to the system EXCEPT:
   A. a toxic discharge
   B. a heavy storm altering flows
   C. cold temperatures slowing metabolism
   D. a Great Vowel Shift in pronunciation

7. [Reference] In the passage, “this recycling” refers to:
   A. returning settled activated sludge to the aeration basin
   B. reusing detergents in households
   C. cycling stormwater into oceans
   D. recycling metal catalysts in a converter

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces the goal of wastewater treatment, explains activated sludge mechanics, then links operational controls to microbial communities and nutrient removal, ending with sensitivity and energy trade-offs of aeration
   B. It lists city sewer maps without treatment steps
   C. It focuses only on chemical disinfectants and ignores biology
   D. It discusses rivers and lakes but not treatment plants

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that activated sludge is “applied ecology”?
   A. Engineers manage habitats—oxygen, time, and flow—to steer microbial communities that consume pollutants
   B. Ecology is applied by removing all microbes from wastewater
   C. Plants rely on mechanical screens alone
   D. The process converts oxygen directly into clean water

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Activated sludge works mainly by trapping pollutants in filters, so microbes are unnecessary.
   B. The passage explains the activated sludge process as cultivating and recycling microbial flocs to remove organic matter and nutrients, shows how operational controls like return rates and sludge age shape community functions such as nitrification and denitrification, and notes sensitivity to shocks and the energy trade-offs of aeration.
   C. Wastewater treatment succeeds only when oxygen is eliminated from tanks.
   D. Denitrification requires high oxygen and produces ammonia as the final product.
