Passage 0796: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 637)

When temperature anomalies cluster, one sees why researchers have treated reduced
photosynthetic efficiency as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves. reef-scale temperature loggers can make the pattern look unusually sharp; still,
the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than
rely on familiar narratives.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. [A] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the
author frames it as conditional. Should one wishes to move from description to explanation
be true, then the same observation—reduced photosynthetic efficiency—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] This is presented not as a
loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Whereas popular summaries treat
reduced photosynthetic efficiency as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. [C] Later
comparisons reveal why this matters. [D] The argument hinges on what would change under an
alternative explanation. In this sense, thermal bleaching events is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on disease outbreaks, the key question
becomes whether many early studies framed coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves as a
single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized reduced photosynthetic
efficiency as a signature, later work asked whether the same signature survives when
protocols and baselines differ. The passage argues that this shift mattered for how evidence
from the Coral Triangle was generalized because local conditions can change which processes
generate reduced photosynthetic efficiency.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify disease outbreaks did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which reef-scale temperature loggers constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Granted that a single case can be dramatic, the author does
not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
In this sense, loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely has it been the case that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions, at least
before analysts began combining reef-scale temperature loggers with cross-site comparisons.
the goal was to break degeneracies in which reduced photosynthetic efficiency could be
explained in more than one way in part because confounders like disease outbreaks often co-
vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about coral
bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. To be sure, the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, yet the result is a
framework in which reduced photosynthetic efficiency is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. symbiont genotyping
   B. the author’s favorite color
   C. reduced photosynthetic efficiency
   D. Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. The discussion suggests that symbiont clade switching is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'thermal bleaching events' refers to a different field altogether, not to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where photophysiology measurements constrains symbiont clade switching
   D. The passage treats changes in reef fish assemblages as a confounder and symbiont clade switching as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. compound stressors such as acidification and pollution alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. mortality and phase shifts specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. degree-heating-week metrics as a device rather than as an analytic approach

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats symbiont genotyping as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifts in carbonate accretion or symbiont clade switching. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because shifts in carbonate accretion uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that symbiont clade switching is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using symbiont genotyping are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that shifts in carbonate accretion is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how symbiont clade switching can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Red Sea reefs. Finally, it maintains that tests combining symbiont genotyping with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   D. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like symbiont clade switching make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting symbiont genotyping as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict.
   A. important
   B. irrelevant to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves, serving only as background detail
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because shading and cooling refugia dominates all evidence
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like satellite thermal stress maps are needed

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that reef-scale temperature loggers directly measures causes, meaning confounding from local adaptation is impossible.
   B. it prevents recruitment failure from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control local adaptation
   C. Because local adaptation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. Because recruitment failure appears, the mechanism must be unique, so local adaptation can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

7. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using reef-scale temperature loggers.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away compound stressors such as acidification and pollution, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving reef-scale temperature loggers.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when compound stressors such as acidification and pollution can mimic changes in reef fish assemblages.

   B. It replaces symbiont genotyping with intuition.
   C. May be muted by other processes
   D. Co-varies with the driver of interest

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates local adaptation.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on reef-scale temperature loggers simple.
