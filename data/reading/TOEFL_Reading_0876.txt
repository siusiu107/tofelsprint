Passage 0876: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 786)

In classic laboratory tasks, researchers have treated shifted confidence judgments as the
decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization. Granted that
implicit association tests can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues
that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
something that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives.

Using implicit association tests under stable conditions, the author treats the complication
as diagnostic, so one frequently cited case from consumer choice studies appeared to support
the direct-readout view. Even though the original fit looked visually decisive, later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in cultural norms about consistency altered the
baseline enough to mute or mimic shifted confidence judgments. the passage treats this
episode as diagnostic, a move that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—shifted confidence judgments—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
shifted confidence judgments as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on cultural norms about consistency, many
early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization as a single-
mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized shifted confidence judgments as a
signature invites a tidy story, later work asked whether the same signature survives when
protocols and baselines differ forces boundary conditions to be stated. this shift mattered
for how evidence from consumer choice studies was generalized because local conditions can
change which processes generate shifted confidence judgments.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically productive rather
than merely rhetorical. [A] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric would
lead to a different conclusion. by comparing cases in which implicit association tests
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample,
something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B]
The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols are comparable.
Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] This detail becomes
important later, when assumptions are tested. [D] The author uses the example to separate
detection from interpretation. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only after analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-site comparisons
did claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which shifted confidence judgments could be explained in more than one way
because confounders like cultural norms about consistency often co-vary with the driver. as
the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Using implicit association tests under stable conditions, the author treats the complication
as diagnostic, so one frequently cited case from consumer choice studies appeared to support
the direct-readout view. Even if the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in cultural norms about consistency altered the baseline
enough to mute or mimic shifted confidence judgments. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, an outcome that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why
the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which shifted confidence judgments is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on implicit association tests simple.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies one mechanism.

2. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize confounder control?
   A. Because cultural norms about consistency co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if behavioral priming designs produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency
   D. Because selective memory for supporting evidence appears, the mechanism must be unique, so cultural norms about consistency can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The author notes that a single dramatic example can mislead if it is treated as representative rather than as diagnostic.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using behavioral priming designs are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting behavioral priming designs as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats behavioral priming designs as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining behavioral priming designs with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
