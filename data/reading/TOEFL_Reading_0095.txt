Passage 0095: Coral Bleaching as a Breakdown of Symbiosis (Marine Biology)
==========================================================================
(Word count: 612)

A coral reef can appear, to a casual observer, like a garden made of stone. In reality, it
is built by animals that rely on an intimate partnership with microscopic algae. The coral
polyp provides shelter and nutrients; the algae, living inside coral tissue, produce sugars
through photosynthesis that fuel coral growth. This symbiosis is so productive that reefs
thrive in nutrient-poor tropical waters. When the partnership fails, the reef’s colors can
vanish, revealing the white skeleton beneath: a phenomenon known as coral bleaching.

Bleaching is not simply “coral turning white.” It is the expulsion or loss of algal
symbionts and their pigments, often triggered by heat stress. When water temperatures rise
beyond a coral’s tolerance, the photosynthetic machinery of the algae can produce reactive
oxygen species that damage cells. To protect itself from oxidative harm, the coral may eject
the algae or the algae may die. [A] The whiteness is therefore a visible sign of a cellular
crisis.

The consequences depend on duration and severity. A brief heat spike can cause partial
bleaching, after which symbionts return and the coral recovers. A prolonged event, however,
can starve the coral because the photosynthetic subsidy disappears. Starved corals may grow
slowly, reproduce less, and become vulnerable to disease. If starvation persists, mortality
follows, and a reef can shift from coral dominance to algal dominance, altering habitat for
fish and invertebrates. The loss is not only aesthetic; it is structural.

Not all corals respond identically. Species differ in morphology and in their symbiont
communities. Some corals host algal strains that are more heat tolerant, and reefs can
sometimes “shuffle” symbionts after stress, increasing the proportion of tolerant types. Yet
tolerance can trade off with growth: a symbiont that survives heat may provide less energy
under normal conditions. [B] This trade-off complicates the hope that reefs can simply swap
partners and continue unchanged.

Bleaching also interacts with other stressors. Ocean acidification reduces the availability
of carbonate ions needed for skeleton building, making recovery harder. Pollution and
overfishing can shift microbial communities and increase algal overgrowth, which can smother
corals or foster disease. Meanwhile, storms can physically break weakened colonies. Thus, a
bleaching event often acts as a trigger within a larger web of pressures, exposing reefs
that were already strained.

Efforts to protect reefs include reducing local stressors and, more experimentally, assisted
evolution approaches such as selective breeding of heat-tolerant corals or inoculation with
tolerant symbionts. These interventions are constrained by scale: reefs are vast, and heat
waves can affect entire ocean basins. [C] Nevertheless, local protection can preserve
refuges where recovery remains possible, and refuges can serve as seed sources for broader
regions.

Coral bleaching, then, is best understood as a breakdown of partnership. [D] When warming
pushes symbiosis beyond its limits, a reef’s productivity collapses, and the architecture
built by countless tiny animals becomes fragile.

Because bleaching alters reef structure, it can change fish nurseries long after color
returns, making recovery ecological as well as visual.

Some corals host heat-tolerant symbionts, but tolerance can come with trade-offs in growth,
complicating simple rescue narratives.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Efforts to protect reefs include reducing local stressors and, more experimentally, assisted evolution approaches such as selective breeding of heat-tolerant corals or inoculation with tolerant symbionts.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across symbionts
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to bleaching and corals
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of symbionts

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains coral by linking bleaching to corals, and it shows why symbionts changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents corals as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once bleaching is observed, competing explanations for coral collapse. It treats symbionts as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage surveys coral but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed corals first, with bleaching serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats symbionts as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   D. The passage concedes that bleaching is often incomplete and concludes that coral cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since symbionts overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of corals with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, especially regarding corals.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how coral should change if symbionts is altered, instead of assuming that bleaching has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to corals must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage implies that symbionts mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes bleaching effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of corals no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain coral, in the setting discussed.
   C. The passage treats bleaching primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over corals are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about coral are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, given the evidence cited, given the evidence cited.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in symbionts, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of bleaching is enough to validate corals for coral.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of radiocarbon reservoir effects as a factor influencing bleaching
   B. discussion of corals as a factor influencing bleaching
   C. discussion of coral as a factor influencing bleaching, especially regarding after.
   D. discussion of symbionts as a factor influencing bleaching

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Efforts to protect reefs include reducing local stressors and, more experimentally, assisted evolution approaches such as selective breeding of heat-tolerant corals or inoculation with tolerant symbionts.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   B. Efforts to protect reefs include reducing local stressors and. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. Efforts to protect reefs include reducing local stressors and. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents corals from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold symbionts constant while examining bleaching.
   B. Because the presence of corals guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in symbionts are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because bleaching directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding coral.
   D. Because once bleaching fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and symbionts can be ignored without changing conclusions about coral.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | bleaching | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | symbionts | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It proves corals is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that coral should be read alongside symbionts, because bleaching alone does not settle what corals means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This symbiosis is so productive that reefs thrive in nutrient-poor tropical waters.
   A. the idea that The coral polyp provides shelter and nutrients; the algae, living inside coral tissue, produce sugars through photosynthesis that fuel coral growth
   B. the idea that When the partnership fails, the reef’s colors can vanish, revealing the white skeleton beneath: a phenomenon known as coral bleaching
   C. the idea that In reality, it is built by animals that rely on an intimate partnership with microscopic algae, in the context of the passage.
   D. the idea that Some corals host heat-tolerant symbionts, but tolerance can come with trade-offs in growth, complicating simple rescue narratives
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term coral belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   B. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of bleaching and corals should be abandoned altogether.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses corals, so debate over bleaching is unnecessary noise, especially regarding bleaching, especially regarding after.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of bleaching lead to different conclusions about coral.
