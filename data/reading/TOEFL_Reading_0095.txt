Passage 0095: Coral Bleaching as a Breakdown of Symbiosis (Marine Biology)
==========================================================================
(Word count: 612)

A coral reef can appear, to a casual observer, like a garden made of stone. In reality, it
is built by animals that rely on an intimate partnership with microscopic algae. The coral
polyp provides shelter and nutrients; the algae, living inside coral tissue, produce sugars
through photosynthesis that fuel coral growth. This symbiosis is so productive that reefs
thrive in nutrient-poor tropical waters. When the partnership fails, the reef’s colors can
vanish, revealing the white skeleton beneath: a phenomenon known as coral bleaching.

Bleaching is not simply “coral turning white.” It is the expulsion or loss of algal
symbionts and their pigments, often triggered by heat stress. When water temperatures rise
beyond a coral’s tolerance, the photosynthetic machinery of the algae can produce reactive
oxygen species that damage cells. To protect itself from oxidative harm, the coral may eject
the algae or the algae may die. [A] The whiteness is therefore a visible sign of a cellular
crisis.

The consequences depend on duration and severity. A brief heat spike can cause partial
bleaching, after which symbionts return and the coral recovers. A prolonged event, however,
can starve the coral because the photosynthetic subsidy disappears. Starved corals may grow
slowly, reproduce less, and become vulnerable to disease. If starvation persists, mortality
follows, and a reef can shift from coral dominance to algal dominance, altering habitat for
fish and invertebrates. The loss is not only aesthetic; it is structural.

Not all corals respond identically. Species differ in morphology and in their symbiont
communities. Some corals host algal strains that are more heat tolerant, and reefs can
sometimes “shuffle” symbionts after stress, increasing the proportion of tolerant types. Yet
tolerance can trade off with growth: a symbiont that survives heat may provide less energy
under normal conditions. [B] This trade-off complicates the hope that reefs can simply swap
partners and continue unchanged.

Bleaching also interacts with other stressors. Ocean acidification reduces the availability
of carbonate ions needed for skeleton building, making recovery harder. Pollution and
overfishing can shift microbial communities and increase algal overgrowth, which can smother
corals or foster disease. Meanwhile, storms can physically break weakened colonies. Thus, a
bleaching event often acts as a trigger within a larger web of pressures, exposing reefs
that were already strained.

Efforts to protect reefs include reducing local stressors and, more experimentally, assisted
evolution approaches such as selective breeding of heat-tolerant corals or inoculation with
tolerant symbionts. These interventions are constrained by scale: reefs are vast, and heat
waves can affect entire ocean basins. [C] Nevertheless, local protection can preserve
refuges where recovery remains possible, and refuges can serve as seed sources for broader
regions.

Coral bleaching, then, is best understood as a breakdown of partnership. [D] When warming
pushes symbiosis beyond its limits, a reef’s productivity collapses, and the architecture
built by countless tiny animals becomes fragile.

Because bleaching alters reef structure, it can change fish nurseries long after color
returns, making recovery ecological as well as visual.

Some corals host heat-tolerant symbionts, but tolerance can come with trade-offs in growth,
complicating simple rescue narratives.

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word “expulsion” is closest in meaning to:
   A. to store objects in a warehouse
   B. to confuse the reader with unrelated details
   C. the ejection or loss of something from within
   D. to reverse a decision completely


3. [Factual] According to the passage, which statement is supported?
   A. coral bleaching plays a central role in the process described, interacting with symbionts rather than acting alone.
   B. coral bleaching plays a central role in the process described, interacting with ocean rather than acting alone. This would occur only when nurseries dominates.
   C. coral bleaching plays a central role in the process described, interacting with symbionts rather than acting alone. This would require stressors to be the limiting factor.
   D. coral bleaching plays a central role in the process described, interacting with symbionts rather than acting alone. This would occur only when narratives dominates.


4. [Negative Factual] All of the following are discussed in the passage EXCEPT:
   A. an explanation of bond yields and inflation-indexed securities.
   B. limitations or trade-offs involving heat stress.
   C. the role of coral bleaching in shaping outcomes.
   D. how symbionts modifies or mediates the central phenomenon.


5. [Rhetorical Purpose] The passage mentions a contrasting possibility primarily to:
   A. to show that explaining coral bleaching requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account. This would require breakdown to be the limiting factor.
   B. to show that explaining coral bleaching requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account. That would make tolerance the primary constraint.
   C. to show that explaining coral bleaching requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account.
   D. to show that explaining coral bleaching requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account by tying the effect to dominance.


6. [Inference] Which inference is most strongly supported by the passage?
   A. Changes in symbionts can shift the consequences of coral bleaching, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same.
   B. Changes in symbionts must shift the consequences of coral bleaching, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same. That would make dominance the primary constraint.
