Passage 0095: Transmission Spectroscopy and What Exoplanet Atmospheres Reveal (Astronomy)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 614)

A planet that cannot be imaged can still leave a fingerprint. When an exoplanet passes in
front of its star, the star’s brightness dips by an amount set largely by geometry: the
planet blocks a fraction of the stellar disk. Yet the dip is not identical at every
wavelength. If the planet has an atmosphere, then at wavelengths where atmospheric gases
absorb strongly, the planet appears slightly larger because the starlight is blocked higher
up. Measuring that wavelength-dependent transit depth produces a transmission spectrum, and
from that spectrum astronomers attempt to identify molecules and to infer temperature and
composition.

The underlying cause is the altitude at which the atmosphere becomes opaque along the slant
path of the starlight. An atmosphere with a large scale height—one that is hot and composed
of light molecules—extends farther, so absorption features can be larger. Conversely, a
cooler atmosphere or one dominated by heavier molecules produces smaller features. [A] Even
before naming any molecule, the shape of a spectrum can therefore hint at physical
conditions by indicating how “puffed up” the atmosphere is.

Specific molecules create characteristic patterns. Water vapor imprints broad bands in the
near-infrared; sodium and potassium produce narrower features in the visible for certain hot
planets; carbon dioxide and methane have their own bands at other wavelengths. Yet the
measurement is demanding, because the signal is small: the difference between an absorbing
and a transparent wavelength can correspond to only a few parts per million in stellar flux
for a small planet. Instrument stability, detector systematics, and stellar variability can
all masquerade as atmospheric structure, so observers often repeat transits and compare with
reference stars or with instrumental models.

A second complication arises from aerosols and condensate clouds, which can mute spectral
features. If high-altitude particles scatter light broadly, the atmosphere can become opaque
at similar altitudes across many wavelengths, flattening the spectrum. In such a case, a
featureless spectrum does not mean “no atmosphere”; it can mean “an atmosphere whose
absorption is hidden.” [B] The same data can thus be consistent with multiple physical
pictures, and interpretation becomes a contest among explanations that fit both physics and
observation.

To decide among possibilities, researchers combine information. They may use eclipse
spectra, measured when the planet passes behind the star, to sample the planet’s thermal
emission, or phase curves to track brightness changes through the orbit. They also
incorporate stellar properties, because an active star with spots can alter the apparent
transit depth in a wavelength-dependent way. If a planet crosses a dark stellar spot, the
transit looks deeper; if unocculted spots exist elsewhere, the star’s baseline spectrum
changes. Correcting for these effects requires careful modeling and, often, additional
observations of the star itself.

Despite these challenges, the payoff is conceptual as well as catalog-like. Atmospheres
provide clues about formation. A planet with a hydrogen-rich envelope may have accreted gas
early and avoided complete loss, whereas a dense, metal-rich atmosphere can indicate
different histories of outgassing and erosion. Over time, ultraviolet radiation can strip
atmospheres, especially for close-in planets, and chemistry can be driven out of equilibrium
by photolysis and vertical mixing. [C] In that way, the spectrum is a snapshot of an
atmosphere that has been sculpted by gravity, radiation, and chemistry.

Transmission spectroscopy therefore turns a geometric transit into a chemical inquiry. [D]
By watching starlight filter through alien air, astronomers link tiny, wavelength-dependent
dips to molecules, temperatures, and planetary histories that would otherwise remain
invisible.

Even so, repeated transits can accumulate signal, turning many faint shadows into a spectrum
with interpretable structure.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the starlight grazes the limb, the relevant path length is long, making even trace absorbers potentially detectable.
   A. [A]

2. [Vocabulary] The word “opaque” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. not allowing light to pass through effectively
   B. perfectly reflective like a mirror
   C. moving rapidly across an orbit
   D. caused by economic consolidation

3. [Factual] According to the passage, why can a planet appear larger at certain wavelengths during a transit?
   A. Because atmospheric gases absorb starlight so the effective blocking altitude is higher where absorption is strong
   B. Because the planet physically expands and contracts each orbit
   C. Because the star becomes smaller at red wavelengths
   D. Because aerosols create extra gravity that pulls the atmosphere inward

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why a “featureless” transmission spectrum does not necessarily mean an atmosphere is absent?
   A. High-altitude particles can flatten features by making the atmosphere similarly opaque across wavelengths
   B. Starlight cannot pass through any atmosphere ever
   C. Water vapor produces no absorption bands in any case
   D. Planets without atmospheres always show deep spectral lines

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss stellar spots and activity?
   A. To show that stellar variability can mimic wavelength-dependent transit signals and must be accounted for
   B. To argue that stars contain the same molecules as planets
   C. To claim that transmission spectra require imaging planets directly
   D. To suggest that reference stars are unnecessary for calibration

   A. detector systematics
   B. instrument stability
   C. stellar variability
   D. salt efflorescence on plaster walls

   A. learning about planetary composition and formation history by interpreting atmospheric spectra
   B. catching more fish by adjusting quotas
   C. reducing pain through placebo rituals
   D. growing thicker basalt columns by slowing cooling

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains how transmission spectra arise, then describes molecular signatures and key complications such as systematics and aerosols, and concludes with why atmospheres inform formation and evolution
   B. It provides a chronological list of every exoplanet discovered
   C. It argues that transits cannot reveal anything about atmospheres
   D. It focuses only on telescope mirror polishing

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the role of scale height in the passage?
   A. A hotter, lighter atmosphere extends higher and can produce larger spectral features because opacity changes occur over greater altitude ranges
   B. Scale height refers to the star’s radius and does not affect spectra
   C. Heavier molecules always increase feature size by making air denser
   D. Scale height matters only for planets that are directly imaged

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Transmission spectroscopy is described as impossible because transit depth never varies with wavelength.
   B. The passage explains that during a transit, an exoplanet’s atmosphere can cause wavelength-dependent changes in the planet’s apparent size, producing a transmission spectrum with molecular absorption patterns; it emphasizes the small signal and the need to manage instrumental and stellar systematics, notes that aerosols can flatten features and create interpretive ambiguity, and argues that atmospheric measurements can reveal physical conditions and formation histories shaped by radiation and chemistry.
   C. Atmospheric spectra are said to be determined only by ocean swells and bird behavior.
   D. Aerosols are claimed to always produce deeper spectral lines that uniquely identify methane.
