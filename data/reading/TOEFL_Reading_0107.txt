Passage 0107: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 750)

Despite tidy textbook narratives, researchers found that researchers have treated shifts in
industrial labor demand as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. Granted that labor market inference from wage series can make the pattern
look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move from description
to explanation, then the same observation—shifts in industrial labor demand—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries
treat shifts in industrial labor demand as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder
to interpret without assumptions. In this sense, african american internal migration is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—shifts
in industrial labor demand—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which
it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat shifts in industrial labor demand as an endpoint
is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify racial violence and
intimidation, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather
than merely rhetorical. [A] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can
masquerade as mechanism. by comparing cases in which labor market inference from wage series
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample,
which is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The
passage highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. Even though a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. [C] The passage returns to this point to
clarify what counts as evidence. [D] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike Philadelphia. the
same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because,
as the author notes, racial violence and intimidation shifted the baseline in different
directions across sites. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation—not
treating shifts in industrial labor demand as a self-sufficient conclusion.

It is the apparent regularity of shifts in industrial labor demand, rather than a single
headline feature, that drives the first interpretation: shifts in industrial labor demand is
treated as a direct readout of mechanism. Provided that shifts in industrial labor demand is
uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then observations from Philadelphia would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. Rather than the caveat that
racial violence and intimidation might reproduce the same pattern, the passage emphasizes
that the literature is full of such claims. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration
flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted
that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which shifts in industrial labor demand is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once segregation and redlining signatures is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Since segregation and redlining signatures is observed in Chicago, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. it prevents segregation and redlining signatures from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control wartime industry demand
   D. Because segregation and redlining signatures appears, the mechanism must be unique, so wartime industry demand can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

2. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Provided that one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—shifts in industrial labor demand—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. push–pull dynamics alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. shifts in industrial labor demand specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. census microdata analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using census microdata analysis.
   B. The passage suggests that political realignment patterns is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving census microdata analysis.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when push–pull dynamics can mimic political realignment patterns.

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'twentieth-century Black migration flows' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where oral history synthesis constrains push–pull dynamics
   C. The passage treats segregation and redlining signatures as a confounder and push–pull dynamics as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The discussion suggests that push–pull dynamics is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

5. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The author notes that a single dramatic example can mislead if it is treated as representative rather than as diagnostic.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates push–pull dynamics.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on census microdata analysis simple.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Chicago and everywhere else.

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that changes in neighborhood composition is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how racial violence and intimidation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Philadelphia. Finally, it maintains that tests combining labor market inference from wage series with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   B. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like racial violence and intimidation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting labor market inference from wage series as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats labor market inference from wage series as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in neighborhood composition or racial violence and intimidation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that racial violence and intimidation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using labor market inference from wage series are unnecessary.

8. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because, as the author notes, racial violence and intimidation shifted the baseline in different directions across sites.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like oral history synthesis are needed
   B. unclear
   C. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because housing covenants and policy constraints dominates all evidence

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   B. the length of the Nile in miles
   C. housing record reconstruction
