Passage 0507: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 760)

Across multiple northern cities, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated segregation and redlining signatures as the decisive sign of the
great migration and northern urban transformation. census microdata analysis can make the
pattern look unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional
and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data
collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Using census microdata analysis
under stable conditions, the author treats the complication as diagnostic, so one frequently
cited case from Detroit appeared to support the direct-readout view. Granted that the
original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts
in housing covenants and policy constraints altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic
segregation and redlining signatures. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, a move
that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. In this sense, african american internal migration is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. the first model can fit one dataset
extremely well; still, the passage insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown,
not assumed. it highlights how housing covenants and policy constraints can shift baselines,
altering whether segregation and redlining signatures is even comparable across cases, which
helps explain why means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation. Were housing
covenants and policy constraints is changed while the nominal driver remains constant to
fail, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. Only through
analysts began combining census microdata analysis with cross-site comparisons could one
reasonably claim that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which segregation and redlining signatures could be explained
in more than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like housing covenants and
policy constraints often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes
whether two analyses are actually comparable. What matters most is methodological humility,
which is why the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban
transformation: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one
wishes to move from description to explanation is granted, then the same
observation—segregation and redlining signatures—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat segregation and redlining
signatures as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. In this sense,
south-to-north population movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label. Only through analysts began combining census microdata analysis with cross-
site comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about the great migration and
northern urban transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. [A] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a
decisive test. the goal was to break degeneracies in which segregation and redlining
signatures could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like housing
covenants and policy constraints often co-vary with the driver. [B] Later comparisons reveal
why this matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable. [C] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which
prediction follows. [D] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be
discarded. The decisive factor is the apparent regularity of segregation and redlining
signatures; once that is stated, drives the first interpretation: segregation and redlining
signatures is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. If segregation and redlining
signatures is uniquely produced by one causal pathway holds, then observations from Detroit
would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. Rather than the caveat
that housing covenants and policy constraints might reproduce the same pattern, the passage
emphasizes that the literature is full of such claims. In this sense, twentieth-century
black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the
evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The passage underscores that transparency about priors can be more informative than presenting one visually impressive fit.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The discussion suggests that wartime industry demand is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where labor market inference from wage series constrains wartime industry demand
   C. The author argues that labor market inference from wage series should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The passage implies that Philadelphia is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

3. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | labor market inference from wage series | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | changes in neighborhood composition | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | housing covenants and policy constraints | Changes the apparent slope |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves changes in neighborhood composition is unique.
   B. Changes the apparent slope
   C. Can vary across epochs
   D. Requires careful calibration

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like wartime industry demand make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting oral history synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats oral history synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in neighborhood composition or wartime industry demand. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that wartime industry demand is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using oral history synthesis are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that changes in neighborhood composition is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how wartime industry demand can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Philadelphia. Finally, it maintains that tests combining oral history synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: it highlights how housing covenants and policy constraints can shift baselines, altering whether segregation and redlining signatures is even comparable across cases, which helps explain why means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Harlem and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on newspaper archive research simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates housing covenants and policy constraints.

6. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. important
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like census microdata analysis are needed
   C. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because wartime industry demand dominates all evidence

7. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that boundary conditions is important mainly because:
   A. Because political realignment patterns appears, the mechanism must be unique, so housing covenants and policy constraints can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. it prevents political realignment patterns from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control housing covenants and policy constraints
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if newspaper archive research produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. The passage implies that newspaper archive research directly measures causes, meaning confounding from housing covenants and policy constraints is impossible.

8. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when wartime industry demand can mimic changes in neighborhood composition.
   B. The author treats Detroit as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away wartime industry demand, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The passage suggests that changes in neighborhood composition is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
