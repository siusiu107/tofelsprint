Passage 0659: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 727)

Despite seemingly clear effect sizes, one sees why researchers have treated devaluation of
rejected alternatives as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. Although meta-analytic synthesis can make the pattern look unusually sharp,
the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Only by analysts began combining meta-analytic synthesis with cross-site comparisons was the
field forced to accept that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which devaluation of rejected
alternatives could be explained in more than one way because, as the author notes,
confounders like cultural norms about consistency often co-vary with the driver. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense,
post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike consumer choice studies. [A] The passage
emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating them as afterthoughts. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because, as the
author notes, cultural norms about consistency shifted the baseline in different directions
across sites. [B] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data
cannot rule out. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation—not treating
devaluation of rejected alternatives as a self-sufficient conclusion. [C] The discussion
makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. [D] The author implies
that replication is informative only when protocols are comparable.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which meta-analytic synthesis constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to
admit that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. To be
sure, a single case can be dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, dissonance
reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation holds, then the same observation—devaluation of rejected alternatives—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat devaluation of rejected alternatives as an endpoint in one account, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in
another.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather
than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which meta-analytic synthesis constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, something that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Despite the fact
that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, self-justification
mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even
though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which devaluation of rejected alternatives is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The author argues that choice-induced preference paradigms should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The passage treats shifted confidence judgments as a confounder and cultural norms about consistency as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The passage implies that workplace decision settings is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where choice-induced preference paradigms constrains cultural norms about consistency

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting choice-induced preference paradigms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-national survey samples. Finally, it maintains that tests combining choice-induced preference paradigms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   C. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using choice-induced preference paradigms are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats choice-induced preference paradigms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifted confidence judgments is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Since shifted confidence judgments is observed in workplace decision settings, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency
