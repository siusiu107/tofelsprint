Passage 0072: Slow Slip and the Quiet Mechanics of Subduction
=============================================================
(Word count: 614)

To most people, earthquakes arrive as surprises, yet a fault does not switch from “still” to
“moving” in an instant. Along subduction zones—where an oceanic plate dives beneath a
continental plate—some parts of the boundary are locked for decades, storing strain that is
released in megathrust earthquakes. Other parts, however, slide in a quieter, slower way.
Over the last two decades, geophysicists have documented slow slip events: episodes in which
a fault creeps centimeters over days to months, releasing energy without the violent shaking
that characterizes typical earthquakes.

The discovery depended on instruments rather than on felt experience. Continuous GPS
networks revealed that, in certain regions, the ground would drift subtly backward—opposite
the motion expected from steady plate convergence—before returning to its prior trend. The
motion was small, but it was coherent across stations, suggesting a deep fault process
rather than a local landslide. In some cases, the slow slip coincided with bursts of low-
frequency seismic tremor, a soft, prolonged signal distinct from the sharp arrivals of
ordinary quakes. [A] Together, slow slip and tremor imply that a portion of the fault is
neither fully locked nor freely sliding, but poised in an intermediate frictional regime.

Why would one segment creep while another locks? Temperature is part of the answer. Near the
surface, rocks can be brittle and stick–slip behavior is common. Deeper, where temperatures
and pressures are higher, rocks can deform more ductilely, making stable sliding more
likely. Yet slow slip often occurs at depths where temperatures should still allow
stick–slip, which is why fluids have become central to explanations. Water released from the
descending slab can raise pore pressure in the fault zone, reducing the effective normal
stress that clamps the fault. When clamping is reduced, even a rough, irregular interface
can slide more easily. [B] A transient increase in pore pressure can therefore tip a segment
from locked to creeping without requiring a change in plate motion.

The timing of slow slip can be rhythmic. In parts of Japan and Cascadia, slow slip repeats
every year or two; elsewhere it is more irregular. Such periodicity suggests that the fault
system loads and relaxes in cycles, possibly because fluids migrate, because permeability
changes with stress, or because the interface alternates between sealing and leaking.
Importantly, slow slip can transfer stress to adjacent segments. If a creeping patch
unloads, a neighboring locked patch may be pushed closer to failure, even if the slow slip
itself was gentle. This has raised interest in whether slow slip can serve as a precursor to
larger events. The answer is cautious. Some major earthquakes have been preceded by slow
slip, but many slow slip events occur without a large quake, and some large quakes occur
without obvious slow precursors.

The practical significance is twofold. First, slow slip demonstrates that the fault is a
dynamic system with multiple modes of motion, so “locked” and “unlocked” are not permanent
labels. Second, slow slip expands the concept of seismic hazard. A city may be threatened
not only by the next megathrust rupture, but also by how stress is shuffled by deep, unseen
slip episodes. To integrate slow slip into hazard models, researchers map where it occurs,
how much slip accumulates, and how it interacts with the locked zone above.

Slow slip, then, does not eliminate earthquake risk, but it reframes it. [C] It shows that
plate boundaries can move in whispers as well as in shouts, and that those whispers can
reshape the timing and location of the next shout. [D]

Because temperature and pore pressure vary with depth, the same fault segment can slide
quietly in one season and lock in another.


Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, slow slip events are best described as:

   Sentence to insert: That mixed behavior helps explain why the signal was invisible before dense geodetic networks existed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why fluids can promote slow slip?
   A. By increasing pore pressure, fluids reduce effective clamping, allowing sliding to occur more easily

   A. fluid migration
   B. stress-related permeability changes
   C. sealing and leaking of the interface
   D. seasonal changes in solar radiation heating the mantle by hundreds of degrees

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention that some large earthquakes occur without obvious slow precursors?
   A. To caution against treating slow slip as a reliable warning signal in every case
   B. To argue that slow slip never happens in subduction zones
   C. To suggest that GPS measurements are useless for fault studies
   D. To claim that tremor is identical to ordinary seismic waves

7. [Reference] In the passage, “those whispers” refers to:
   A. deep, quiet slow slip episodes that redistribute stress
   B. audible sounds produced by earthquakes
   C. political debates about hazard maps
   D. wind noise recorded by seismometers

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It defines slow slip, describes how it was detected, explains likely physical causes, then discusses timing, stress transfer, and implications for hazard modeling
   B. It lists subduction zones by latitude only
   C. It argues that earthquakes are purely random and cannot be studied
   D. It focuses only on surface geology and ignores deep faults

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that “locked” and “unlocked” are not permanent labels?
   A. Fault segments can shift between creeping and sticking depending on conditions such as fluids and stress
   B. Once a fault locks, it can never move again
   C. Unlocked means the plates have separated permanently
   D. Labels are irrelevant because plates do not converge

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Slow slip events are rare atmospheric phenomena unrelated to plate tectonics.
   B. The passage explains slow slip events in subduction zones as days-to-months fault movements detected by GPS and often associated with tremor, outlines explanations involving depth-dependent friction and fluid-driven pore pressure, and discusses how slow slip can redistribute stress and complicate seismic hazard without serving as a universal earthquake warning.
   C. Slow slip prevents megathrust earthquakes by releasing all accumulated strain.
   D. Tremor proves that every slow slip event will be followed immediately by a major quake.
