Passage 0072: Slow Slip and the Quiet Mechanics of Subduction
=============================================================
(Word count: 614)

To most people, earthquakes arrive as surprises, yet a fault does not switch from “still” to
“moving” in an instant. Along subduction zones—where an oceanic plate dives beneath a
continental plate—some parts of the boundary are locked for decades, storing strain that is
released in megathrust earthquakes. Other parts, however, slide in a quieter, slower way.
Over the last two decades, geophysicists have documented slow slip events: episodes in which
a fault creeps centimeters over days to months, releasing energy without the violent shaking
that characterizes typical earthquakes.

The discovery depended on instruments rather than on felt experience. Continuous GPS
networks revealed that, in certain regions, the ground would drift subtly backward—opposite
the motion expected from steady plate convergence—before returning to its prior trend. The
motion was small, but it was coherent across stations, suggesting a deep fault process
rather than a local landslide. In some cases, the slow slip coincided with bursts of low-
frequency seismic tremor, a soft, prolonged signal distinct from the sharp arrivals of
ordinary quakes. [A] Together, slow slip and tremor imply that a portion of the fault is
neither fully locked nor freely sliding, but poised in an intermediate frictional regime.

Why would one segment creep while another locks? Temperature is part of the answer. Near the
surface, rocks can be brittle and stick–slip behavior is common. Deeper, where temperatures
and pressures are higher, rocks can deform more ductilely, making stable sliding more
likely. Yet slow slip often occurs at depths where temperatures should still allow
stick–slip, which is why fluids have become central to explanations. Water released from the
descending slab can raise pore pressure in the fault zone, reducing the effective normal
stress that clamps the fault. When clamping is reduced, even a rough, irregular interface
can slide more easily. [B] A transient increase in pore pressure can therefore tip a segment
from locked to creeping without requiring a change in plate motion.

The timing of slow slip can be rhythmic. In parts of Japan and Cascadia, slow slip repeats
every year or two; elsewhere it is more irregular. Such periodicity suggests that the fault
system loads and relaxes in cycles, possibly because fluids migrate, because permeability
changes with stress, or because the interface alternates between sealing and leaking.
Importantly, slow slip can transfer stress to adjacent segments. If a creeping patch
unloads, a neighboring locked patch may be pushed closer to failure, even if the slow slip
itself was gentle. This has raised interest in whether slow slip can serve as a precursor to
larger events. The answer is cautious. Some major earthquakes have been preceded by slow
slip, but many slow slip events occur without a large quake, and some large quakes occur
without obvious slow precursors.

The practical significance is twofold. First, slow slip demonstrates that the fault is a
dynamic system with multiple modes of motion, so “locked” and “unlocked” are not permanent
labels. Second, slow slip expands the concept of seismic hazard. A city may be threatened
not only by the next megathrust rupture, but also by how stress is shuffled by deep, unseen
slip episodes. To integrate slow slip into hazard models, researchers map where it occurs,
how much slip accumulates, and how it interacts with the locked zone above.

Slow slip, then, does not eliminate earthquake risk, but it reframes it. [C] It shows that
plate boundaries can move in whispers as well as in shouts, and that those whispers can
reshape the timing and location of the next shout. [D]

Because temperature and pore pressure vary with depth, the same fault segment can slide
quietly in one season and lock in another.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, slow slip events are best described as:
   A. fault movements that release strain over days to months with little or no strong shaking by tying the effect to quiet.
   B. fault movements that release strain over days to months with little or no strong shaking. This would occur only when along dominates.
   C. fault movements that release strain over days to months with little or no strong shaking.
   D. fault movements that release strain over days to months with little or no strong shaking. This outcome would hold even if first stays constant.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “coherent” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. loud enough to be heard by people
   B. chemically pure in sense

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why fluids can promote slow slip?
   A. By increasing pore pressure, fluids reduce effective clamping, allowing sliding to occur more easily by tying the effect to deeper.
   B. By increasing pore pressure, fluids reduce effective clamping, allowing sliding to occur less easily. This outcome would hold even if quiet stays constant.

   D. stress-related permeability changes in this discussion.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention that some large earthquakes occur without obvious slow precursors?
   A. To caution against treating slow slip as a reliable warning signal in every case. This would require temperatures to be the limiting factor.
   B. To caution against treating slow slip as a reliable warning signal in every case.
   C. To caution against treating slow slip as a reliable warning signal in every case by tying the effect to subduction.

   D. It defines slow slip, describes how it was detected, explains likely physical causes, then discusses timing, stress transfer, and implications for hazard modeling. This would occur only when earthquakes dominates.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that “locked” and “unlocked” are not permanent labels?
   A. Fault segments can shift between creeping and sticking depending on conditions such as fluids and stress.
   B. Fault segments can shift between creeping and sticking depending on conditions such as fluids and stress by tying the effect to irregular.
