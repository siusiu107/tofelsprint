Passage 0072: Slow Slip and the Quiet Mechanics of Subduction
=============================================================
(Word count: 614)

To most people, earthquakes arrive as surprises, yet a fault does not switch from “still” to
“moving” in an instant. Along subduction zones—where an oceanic plate dives beneath a
continental plate—some parts of the boundary are locked for decades, storing strain that is
released in megathrust earthquakes. Other parts, however, slide in a quieter, slower way.
Over the last two decades, geophysicists have documented slow slip events: episodes in which
a fault creeps centimeters over days to months, releasing energy without the violent shaking
that characterizes typical earthquakes.

The discovery depended on instruments rather than on felt experience. Continuous GPS
networks revealed that, in certain regions, the ground would drift subtly backward—opposite
the motion expected from steady plate convergence—before returning to its prior trend. The
motion was small, but it was coherent across stations, suggesting a deep fault process
rather than a local landslide. In some cases, the slow slip coincided with bursts of low-
frequency seismic tremor, a soft, prolonged signal distinct from the sharp arrivals of
ordinary quakes. [A] Together, slow slip and tremor imply that a portion of the fault is
neither fully locked nor freely sliding, but poised in an intermediate frictional regime.

Why would one segment creep while another locks? Temperature is part of the answer. Near the
surface, rocks can be brittle and stick–slip behavior is common. Deeper, where temperatures
and pressures are higher, rocks can deform more ductilely, making stable sliding more
likely. Yet slow slip often occurs at depths where temperatures should still allow
stick–slip, which is why fluids have become central to explanations. Water released from the
descending slab can raise pore pressure in the fault zone, reducing the effective normal
stress that clamps the fault. When clamping is reduced, even a rough, irregular interface
can slide more easily. [B] A transient increase in pore pressure can therefore tip a segment
from locked to creeping without requiring a change in plate motion.

The timing of slow slip can be rhythmic. In parts of Japan and Cascadia, slow slip repeats
every year or two; elsewhere it is more irregular. Such periodicity suggests that the fault
system loads and relaxes in cycles, possibly because fluids migrate, because permeability
changes with stress, or because the interface alternates between sealing and leaking.
Importantly, slow slip can transfer stress to adjacent segments. If a creeping patch
unloads, a neighboring locked patch may be pushed closer to failure, even if the slow slip
itself was gentle. This has raised interest in whether slow slip can serve as a precursor to
larger events. The answer is cautious. Some major earthquakes have been preceded by slow
slip, but many slow slip events occur without a large quake, and some large quakes occur
without obvious slow precursors.

The practical significance is twofold. First, slow slip demonstrates that the fault is a
dynamic system with multiple modes of motion, so “locked” and “unlocked” are not permanent
labels. Second, slow slip expands the concept of seismic hazard. A city may be threatened
not only by the next megathrust rupture, but also by how stress is shuffled by deep, unseen
slip episodes. To integrate slow slip into hazard models, researchers map where it occurs,
how much slip accumulates, and how it interacts with the locked zone above.

Slow slip, then, does not eliminate earthquake risk, but it reframes it. [C] It shows that
plate boundaries can move in whispers as well as in shouts, and that those whispers can
reshape the timing and location of the next shout. [D]

Because temperature and pore pressure vary with depth, the same fault segment can slide
quietly in one season and lock in another.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Over the last two decades, geophysicists have documented slow slip events: episodes in which a fault creeps centimeters over days to months, releasing energy without the violent shaking that characterizes typical earthquakes.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to locked and plate
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of earthquakes
   D. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across earthquakes

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents plate as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once locked is observed, competing explanations for fault collapse. It treats earthquakes as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, for the main claim of the text.
   B. The passage concedes that locked is often incomplete and concludes that fault cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since earthquakes overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of plate with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage surveys fault but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed plate first, with locked serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats earthquakes as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   D. The passage explains fault by linking locked to plate, and it shows why earthquakes changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how fault should change if earthquakes is altered, instead of assuming that locked has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to plate must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage implies that earthquakes mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes locked effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of plate no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain fault, in the setting discussed, especially regarding earthquakes, given the evidence cited.
   C. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in earthquakes, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of locked is enough to validate plate for fault.
   D. The passage treats locked primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over plate are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about fault are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of earthquakes as a factor influencing locked
   B. discussion of plate as a factor influencing locked
   C. discussion of fault as a factor influencing locked, for the main claim of the text.
   D. discussion of archival bias as a factor influencing locked

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Over the last two decades, geophysicists have documented slow slip events: episodes in which a fault creeps centimeters over days to months, releasing energy without the violent shaking that characterizes typical earthquakes.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   B. Over the last two decades. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. Over the last two decades. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents plate from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold earthquakes constant while examining locked.
   B. Because the presence of plate guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in earthquakes are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because once locked fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and earthquakes can be ignored without changing conclusions about fault.
   D. Because locked directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding fault.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | locked | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | earthquakes | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It proves plate is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that fault should be read alongside earthquakes, because locked alone does not settle what plate means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This has raised interest in whether slow slip can serve as a precursor to larger events.
   A. the preceding claim that locked is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   B. the preceding claim that fault functions as a direct measurement of plate
   C. the preceding claim that earthquakes alone explains the outcome of fault
   D. the preceding claim about how locked is interpreted in relation to plate

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses plate, so debate over locked is unnecessary noise, as the discussion implies.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of locked lead to different conclusions about fault.
   C. to show that the term fault belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of locked and plate should be abandoned altogether, especially regarding locked.
