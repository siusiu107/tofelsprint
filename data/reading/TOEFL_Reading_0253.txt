Passage 0253: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 759)

Across multiple northern cities, one sees why researchers have treated segregation and
redlining signatures as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. To be sure, housing record reconstruction can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, yet the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Hardly had analysts began
combining housing record reconstruction with cross-site comparisons occurred when claims
about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped relying on a single
figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in
which segregation and redlining signatures could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like housing covenants and policy constraints often co-vary with the driver,
which is why replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an
empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable. In this sense, african american internal migration is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Not the obvious explanation but the
apparent regularity of segregation and redlining signatures is what drives the first
interpretation: segregation and redlining signatures is treated as a direct readout of
mechanism. Provided that segregation and redlining signatures is uniquely produced by one
causal pathway, then observations from Detroit would be transferable, and disagreement would
be largely technical. the literature is full of such claims, not because the caveat that
housing covenants and policy constraints might reproduce the same pattern, but because the
assumptions differ. Even if the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
housing covenants and policy constraints can shift baselines, altering whether segregation
and redlining signatures is even comparable across cases, which means that a good fit is not
the same as a good explanation. Were housing covenants and policy constraints is changed
while the nominal driver remains constant to fail, one should expect different outcomes when
conditions are perturbed. Not until analysts began combining housing record reconstruction
with cross-site comparisons did claims about the great migration and northern urban
transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. [A] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be
discarded. the goal was to break degeneracies in which segregation and redlining signatures
could be explained in more than one way because confounders like housing covenants and
policy constraints often co-vary with the driver. [B] The passage signals that a tidy fit
may hide degenerate explanations. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an
empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable. [C] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a
decisive test. [D] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead to a
different conclusion. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. What matters most is methodological
humility, which is why the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration and
northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. Were one wishes to move from description to explanation to fail, then the same
observation—segregation and redlining signatures—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat segregation and redlining
signatures as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication.
Using housing record reconstruction under stable conditions, the interpretation shifts, and
one frequently cited case from Detroit appeared to support the direct-readout view. Even if
the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small
shifts in housing covenants and policy constraints altered the baseline enough to mute or
mimic segregation and redlining signatures. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, a
move that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, the analysis suggests the
passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces
competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. housing covenants and policy constraints alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. political realignment patterns specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. labor market inference from wage series as a device rather than as an analytic approach

2. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. Because housing covenants and policy constraints co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. Since political realignment patterns is observed in Philadelphia, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. it prevents political realignment patterns from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control housing covenants and policy constraints
   D. The passage implies that census microdata analysis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from housing covenants and policy constraints is impossible.

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, african american internal migration is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. important
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like newspaper archive research are needed
   C. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because racial violence and intimidation dominates all evidence

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   B. changes in neighborhood composition
   C. labor market inference from wage series
   D. a recipe for bread fermentation

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The discussion suggests that housing covenants and policy constraints is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where labor market inference from wage series constrains housing covenants and policy constraints
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'African American internal migration' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   D. The author argues that labor market inference from wage series should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that changes in neighborhood composition is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how wartime industry demand can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Detroit. Finally, it maintains that tests combining census microdata analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   B. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like wartime industry demand make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting census microdata analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that wartime industry demand is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using census microdata analysis are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats census microdata analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in neighborhood composition or wartime industry demand. It ends without any methodological implication.

7. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats Chicago as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving housing record reconstruction.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when housing covenants and policy constraints can mimic shifts in industrial labor demand.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using housing record reconstruction.

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: the goal was to break degeneracies in which segregation and redlining signatures could be explained in more than one way because confounders like housing covenants and policy constraints often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because segregation and redlining signatures uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates racial violence and intimidation.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on labor market inference from wage series simple.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Detroit and everywhere else.
