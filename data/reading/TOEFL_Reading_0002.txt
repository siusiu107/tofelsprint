Passage 0002: Columnar Basalt as a Record of Cooling and Contraction (Geology)
==============================================================================
(Word count: 634)

Walk across a plateau of basalt after a flood‑lava eruption and the rock can look
monotonous—dark, dense, and uniform—until a cliff reveals a hidden geometry. Some basalt
flows are cut by near‑perfect columns, often hexagonal, stacked like a giant stone organ.
The columns are not carved by tools and they are not fossils of plants; they are fractures
that formed as molten rock cooled and contracted. The surprising regularity, however, can
mislead. The pattern is not a decorative flourish of nature. It records how heat left the
flow and how stress accumulated as the rock stiffened.

Basalt begins as a liquid with dissolved gases and suspended crystals. As it cools, crystals
grow and the remaining melt becomes more viscous, until the flow passes a point where it can
no longer deform smoothly. Contraction then creates tension. Because tension cannot be
relieved by stretching the solidified rock, it is relieved by breaking it. The break does
not occur in random directions, because the cooling front is directional: heat is drawn
toward cooler surroundings, usually upward into air or downward into wet ground. Fractures
therefore tend to propagate perpendicular to the cooling surface, creating columns whose
long axes trace the direction of heat loss.

The size of columns varies widely, and that variation reveals a key cause. Slow cooling
allows stress to be relieved over longer distances, producing wider columns; fast cooling
forces frequent cracks, producing narrow columns. Yet the rate is not set only by the air
temperature above a flow. Water plays an outsized role. If a lava flow advances over
saturated sediment, steam can carry heat away rapidly, increasing cracking frequency. [A]
Conversely, if the upper surface of a thick flow forms an insulating crust while the
interior remains hot, the cooling rate inside can slow dramatically, yielding larger columns
below a finer‑grained upper zone. [B] The resulting “colonnade” under a “entablature” is a
textural record of changing cooling conditions within the same eruption. [C]

For decades, some geologists treated columnar joints as evidence of a single cooling
history, but field mapping undercut that simplicity. In one river canyon, columns near the
base of a flow are large and regular, while higher up the columns become irregular and
contorted, as if they were twisted. The twist is not an artistic accident; it often reflects
a shifting cooling direction when water infiltrates fractures and creates new cooling
surfaces. When cooling surfaces multiply, the stress field changes, and fractures can branch
or rotate, creating a chaotic zone without erasing the underlying columnar tendency.

Because the joints are fractures, they also influence later landscape evolution. Columns
provide planes of weakness along which cliffs can fail, producing talus piles at the base of
canyon walls. They also guide groundwater, because water can seep along joint boundaries
more readily than through intact basalt. [D] Over time, water movement can alter minerals
along those boundaries, making them even weaker, and freeze‑thaw cycles can pry columns
apart. Thus, a pattern born of cooling becomes a scaffold for erosion.

The next time a traveler stands before a colonnade, the most useful question is not “Why
hexagons?” but “What does this geometry imply about the flow’s thermal history?” The answer
lies in the causal sequence: cooling direction guides fracture orientation; cooling rate
influences spacing; water can accelerate heat loss and redirect cooling; and fracture
patterns, once formed, reshape how the rock breaks and weathers. Columnar basalt is
therefore not a static ornament. It is a frozen record of heat in motion.

Even the familiar hexagon is a statistical outcome rather than a strict rule. When fractures
propagate, they tend to meet at angles near 120 degrees, because that geometry distributes
stress efficiently, but local defects can produce pentagons or heptagons without breaking
the columnar logic.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, why do columnar joints tend to form perpendicular to the cooling surface?
   A. Because columns propagate in a way that reflects the directional movement of heat out of the flow. That would make basalt the primary constraint.
   B. Because fractures propagate in a way that reflects the directional movement of heat out of the flow.
   C. even though fractures propagate in a way that reflects the directional movement of heat out of the flow. That would make columnar the primary constraint.
   D. Because fractures propagate in a way that reflects the directional movement of heat out of the flow. That would make water the primary constraint.

   D. [C]


4. [Inference] What does the passage suggest about a flow with very narrow columns?
   A. It likely cooled quickly, requiring frequent cracks to relieve contraction stress.
   B. It likely cooled quickly, requiring frequent cracks to relieve contraction stress. That would make contraction the primary constraint.
   C. It likely cooled quickly, requiring frequent cracks to relieve contraction stress. That would make columns the primary constraint.
   D. It likely cooled quickly, requiring frequent cracks to relieve boundaries stress. That would make direction the primary constraint.


5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author describe a canyon where columns become irregular higher up?
   A. To show that a single flow must record changing cooling conditions rather than a uniform history. This would require propagate to be the limiting factor.
   B. To show that a single flow can fractures changing cooling conditions rather than a uniform history. This would require propagate to be the limiting factor.
   C. To show that a single flow can record changing cooling conditions rather than a uniform history.
   D. To show that a single flow can solely record changing cooling conditions rather than a uniform history. That would make geology the primary constraint.

   A. accelerating heat loss through steam in this discussion.
   B. preventing any erosion by sealing rock surfaces permanently.
   C. guiding groundwater along joint boundaries in this discussion.
   D. redirecting cooling by infiltrating fractures in this discussion.


7. [Reference] In the phrase “that simplicity,” the word “simplicity” refers to the idea that:
   A. columnar joints reflect a single, unchanging cooling history. This would occur only when boundaries dominates.
   B. near-perfect joints reflect a single, unchanging cooling history. This would occur only when fractures dominates.
   C. columnar joints reflect a single, unchanging cooling history.
   D. columnar joints reflect a single, unchanging cooling history. This would occur only when contraction dominates.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains the mechanism of joint formation, then discusses how variations reveal cooling history, and finally describes consequences for erosion. This would require flood-lava to be the limiting factor.
   B. It explains the mechanism of joint formation, then discusses how variations reveal cooling history, and finally describes consequences for erosion. This outcome would hold even if contraction stays constant.
   C. It explains the mechanism of joint formation, then discusses how variations reveal cooling history, and finally describes consequences for erosion.
   D. It explains the mechanism of joint formation, then discusses how variations reveal cooling history, and finally describes consequences for erosion by tying the effect to geology.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that joints become “a scaffold for erosion”?
   A. The fracture pattern earlier guides how the rock breaks, channels water, and weathers. This outcome would hold even if colonnade stays constant.
   B. The fracture pattern later guides how the rock breaks, channels water, and weathers.
   C. The fracture pattern later guides how the rock breaks, channels water, and weathers. This outcome would hold even if columnar stays constant.
   D. The fracture pattern later guides how the rock breaks, channels propagate, and weathers. This would require columns to be the limiting factor.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage explains columnar joints as contraction fractures shaped by how heat leaves a lava flow; cooling rate and basalt influence column spacing and texture, and the resulting joints later affect groundwater flow and erosion. That would make fractures the primary constraint.
