Passage 0002: Columnar Basalt as a Record of Cooling and Contraction (Geology)
==============================================================================
(Word count: 634)

Walk across a plateau of basalt after a flood‑lava eruption and the rock can look
monotonous—dark, dense, and uniform—until a cliff reveals a hidden geometry. Some basalt
flows are cut by near‑perfect columns, often hexagonal, stacked like a giant stone organ.
The columns are not carved by tools and they are not fossils of plants; they are fractures
that formed as molten rock cooled and contracted. The surprising regularity, however, can
mislead. The pattern is not a decorative flourish of nature. It records how heat left the
flow and how stress accumulated as the rock stiffened.

Basalt begins as a liquid with dissolved gases and suspended crystals. As it cools, crystals
grow and the remaining melt becomes more viscous, until the flow passes a point where it can
no longer deform smoothly. Contraction then creates tension. Because tension cannot be
relieved by stretching the solidified rock, it is relieved by breaking it. The break does
not occur in random directions, because the cooling front is directional: heat is drawn
toward cooler surroundings, usually upward into air or downward into wet ground. Fractures
therefore tend to propagate perpendicular to the cooling surface, creating columns whose
long axes trace the direction of heat loss.

The size of columns varies widely, and that variation reveals a key cause. Slow cooling
allows stress to be relieved over longer distances, producing wider columns; fast cooling
forces frequent cracks, producing narrow columns. Yet the rate is not set only by the air
temperature above a flow. Water plays an outsized role. If a lava flow advances over
saturated sediment, steam can carry heat away rapidly, increasing cracking frequency. [A]
Conversely, if the upper surface of a thick flow forms an insulating crust while the
interior remains hot, the cooling rate inside can slow dramatically, yielding larger columns
below a finer‑grained upper zone. [B] The resulting “colonnade” under a “entablature” is a
textural record of changing cooling conditions within the same eruption. [C]

For decades, some geologists treated columnar joints as evidence of a single cooling
history, but field mapping undercut that simplicity. In one river canyon, columns near the
base of a flow are large and regular, while higher up the columns become irregular and
contorted, as if they were twisted. The twist is not an artistic accident; it often reflects
a shifting cooling direction when water infiltrates fractures and creates new cooling
surfaces. When cooling surfaces multiply, the stress field changes, and fractures can branch
or rotate, creating a chaotic zone without erasing the underlying columnar tendency.

Because the joints are fractures, they also influence later landscape evolution. Columns
provide planes of weakness along which cliffs can fail, producing talus piles at the base of
canyon walls. They also guide groundwater, because water can seep along joint boundaries
more readily than through intact basalt. [D] Over time, water movement can alter minerals
along those boundaries, making them even weaker, and freeze‑thaw cycles can pry columns
apart. Thus, a pattern born of cooling becomes a scaffold for erosion.

The next time a traveler stands before a colonnade, the most useful question is not “Why
hexagons?” but “What does this geometry imply about the flow’s thermal history?” The answer
lies in the causal sequence: cooling direction guides fracture orientation; cooling rate
influences spacing; water can accelerate heat loss and redirect cooling; and fracture
patterns, once formed, reshape how the rock breaks and weathers. Columnar basalt is
therefore not a static ornament. It is a frozen record of heat in motion.

Even the familiar hexagon is a statistical outcome rather than a strict rule. When fractures
propagate, they tend to meet at angles near 120 degrees, because that geometry distributes
stress efficiently, but local defects can produce pentagons or heptagons without breaking
the columnar logic.


Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, why do columnar joints tend to form perpendicular to the cooling surface?
   A. Because crystals grow only in vertical directions
   B. Because fractures propagate in a way that reflects the directional movement of heat out of the flow
   C. Because basalt contains hidden plant fibers that guide cracking
   D. Because rivers carve columns into the rock after it solidifies

2. [Vocabulary] The word “monotonous” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. varied
   B. uniform and repetitive
   C. fragile
   D. transparent

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In effect, steam becomes a conveyor belt for thermal energy.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What does the passage suggest about a flow with very narrow columns?
   A. It likely cooled quickly, requiring frequent cracks to relieve contraction stress
   B. It must have formed under extremely low gravity
   C. It cooled so slowly that stress never accumulated
   D. Its columns were carved by human activity

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author describe a canyon where columns become irregular higher up?
   A. To show that a single flow can record changing cooling conditions rather than a uniform history
   B. To argue that irregular columns prove that columns are unrelated to cooling
   C. To suggest that basalt cannot fracture in regular patterns
   D. To claim that water is irrelevant to joint formation

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as ways water matters EXCEPT:
   A. accelerating heat loss through steam
   B. redirecting cooling by infiltrating fractures
   C. guiding groundwater along joint boundaries
   D. preventing any erosion by sealing rock surfaces permanently

7. [Reference] In the phrase “that simplicity,” the word “simplicity” refers to the idea that:
   A. columns are always hexagonal
   B. columnar joints reflect a single, unchanging cooling history
   C. water never affects fracture patterns
   D. basalt never contains crystals

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains the mechanism of joint formation, then discusses how variations reveal cooling history, and finally describes consequences for erosion
   B. It lists famous basalt cliffs without explaining their origin
   C. It compares basalt to sedimentary rock and then switches topics
   D. It presents a debate and refuses to evaluate evidence

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that joints become “a scaffold for erosion”?
   A. The fracture pattern later guides how the rock breaks, channels water, and weathers
   B. Erosion occurs only before the lava cools
   C. Columns prevent water from entering basalt
   D. Erosion eliminates joint patterns instantly

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Columnar basalt forms when rivers carve hexagonal shapes into rock, and column size depends mainly on crystal type.
   B. The passage explains columnar joints as contraction fractures shaped by how heat leaves a lava flow; cooling rate and water influence column spacing and texture, and the resulting joints later affect groundwater flow and erosion.
   C. Basalt columns are fossils of ancient forests preserved by lava.
   D. Columnar patterns are purely aesthetic and provide no information about a flow’s history.
