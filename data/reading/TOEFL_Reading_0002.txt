Passage 0002: Columnar Basalt as a Record of Cooling and Contraction (Geology)
==============================================================================
(Word count: 634)

Walk across a plateau of basalt after a flood‑lava eruption and the rock can look
monotonous—dark, dense, and uniform—until a cliff reveals a hidden geometry. Some basalt
flows are cut by near‑perfect columns, often hexagonal, stacked like a giant stone organ.
The columns are not carved by tools and they are not fossils of plants; they are fractures
that formed as molten rock cooled and contracted. The surprising regularity, however, can
mislead. The pattern is not a decorative flourish of nature. It records how heat left the
flow and how stress accumulated as the rock stiffened.

Basalt begins as a liquid with dissolved gases and suspended crystals. As it cools, crystals
grow and the remaining melt becomes more viscous, until the flow passes a point where it can
no longer deform smoothly. Contraction then creates tension. Because tension cannot be
relieved by stretching the solidified rock, it is relieved by breaking it. The break does
not occur in random directions, because the cooling front is directional: heat is drawn
toward cooler surroundings, usually upward into air or downward into wet ground. Fractures
therefore tend to propagate perpendicular to the cooling surface, creating columns whose
long axes trace the direction of heat loss.

The size of columns varies widely, and that variation reveals a key cause. Slow cooling
allows stress to be relieved over longer distances, producing wider columns; fast cooling
forces frequent cracks, producing narrow columns. Yet the rate is not set only by the air
temperature above a flow. Water plays an outsized role. If a lava flow advances over
saturated sediment, steam can carry heat away rapidly, increasing cracking frequency. [A]
Conversely, if the upper surface of a thick flow forms an insulating crust while the
interior remains hot, the cooling rate inside can slow dramatically, yielding larger columns
below a finer‑grained upper zone. [B] The resulting “colonnade” under a “entablature” is a
textural record of changing cooling conditions within the same eruption. [C]

For decades, some geologists treated columnar joints as evidence of a single cooling
history, but field mapping undercut that simplicity. In one river canyon, columns near the
base of a flow are large and regular, while higher up the columns become irregular and
contorted, as if they were twisted. The twist is not an artistic accident; it often reflects
a shifting cooling direction when water infiltrates fractures and creates new cooling
surfaces. When cooling surfaces multiply, the stress field changes, and fractures can branch
or rotate, creating a chaotic zone without erasing the underlying columnar tendency.

Because the joints are fractures, they also influence later landscape evolution. Columns
provide planes of weakness along which cliffs can fail, producing talus piles at the base of
canyon walls. They also guide groundwater, because water can seep along joint boundaries
more readily than through intact basalt. [D] Over time, water movement can alter minerals
along those boundaries, making them even weaker, and freeze‑thaw cycles can pry columns
apart. Thus, a pattern born of cooling becomes a scaffold for erosion.

The next time a traveler stands before a colonnade, the most useful question is not “Why
hexagons?” but “What does this geometry imply about the flow’s thermal history?” The answer
lies in the causal sequence: cooling direction guides fracture orientation; cooling rate
influences spacing; water can accelerate heat loss and redirect cooling; and fracture
patterns, once formed, reshape how the rock breaks and weathers. Columnar basalt is
therefore not a static ornament. It is a frozen record of heat in motion.

Even the familiar hexagon is a statistical outcome rather than a strict rule. When fractures
propagate, they tend to meet at angles near 120 degrees, because that geometry distributes
stress efficiently, but local defects can produce pentagons or heptagons without breaking
the columnar logic.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The next time a traveler stands before a colonnade, the most useful question is not “Why hexagons?” but “What does this geometry imply about the flow’s thermal history?” The answer lies in the causal sequence: cooling direction guides fracture orientation; cooling rate influences spacing; water can accelerate heat loss and redirect cooling; and fracture patterns, once formed, reshape how the rock breaks and weathers.
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to columns and fractures
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of basalt
   D. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across basalt

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents fractures as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once columns is observed, competing explanations for cooling collapse. It treats basalt as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   B. The passage surveys cooling but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed fractures first, with columns serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats basalt as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   C. The passage explains cooling by linking columns to fractures, and it shows why basalt changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage concedes that columns is often incomplete and concludes that cooling cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since basalt overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of fractures with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, in the cases described.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that basalt mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes columns effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of fractures no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain cooling, given the evidence cited.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in basalt, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of columns is enough to validate fractures for cooling.
   C. The passage treats columns primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over fractures are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about cooling are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, in the examples provided, within the passage’s scope.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how cooling should change if basalt is altered, instead of assuming that columns has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to fractures must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of basalt as a factor influencing columns
   B. discussion of thermal hysteresis as a factor influencing columns
   C. discussion of fractures as a factor influencing columns
   D. discussion of cooling as a factor influencing columns, as the discussion implies.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: The next time a traveler stands before a colonnade, the most useful question is not “Why hexagons?” but “What does this geometry imply about the flow’s thermal history?” The answer lies in the causal sequence: cooling direction guides fracture orientation; cooling rate influences spacing; water can accelerate heat loss and redirect cooling; and fracture patterns, once formed, reshape how the rock breaks and weathers.
   A. The next time a traveler stands before a colonnade. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   D. The next time a traveler stands before a colonnade. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once columns fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and basalt can be ignored without changing conclusions about cooling.
   B. Because columns directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding cooling.
   C. Because the presence of fractures guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in basalt are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because comparability prevents fractures from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold basalt constant while examining columns.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | columns | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | basalt | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves fractures is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that cooling should be read alongside basalt, because columns alone does not settle what fractures means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: The next time a traveler stands before a colonnade, the most useful question is not “Why hexagons?” but “What does this geometry imply about the flow’s thermal history?” The answer lies in the causal sequence: cooling direction guides fracture orientation; cooling rate influences spacing; water can accelerate heat loss and redirect cooling; and fracture patterns, once formed, reshape how the rock breaks and weathers.

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of columns and fractures should be abandoned altogether.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses fractures, so debate over columns is unnecessary noise, in the cases described, in the context of the passage.
   C. to show that the term cooling belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of columns lead to different conclusions about cooling.
