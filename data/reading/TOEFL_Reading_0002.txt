Passage 0002: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 719)

In replication attempts, the passage argues that researchers have treated wealth
accumulation gaps as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Admittedly, mobility tracking with administrative records can make
the pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is
conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about
data collection than about what the data are evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts
to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of residential
segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation,
then the same observation—wealth accumulation gaps—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat wealth accumulation gaps
as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. In this sense, spatial
stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Even though the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how credit market
discrimination can shift baselines, altering whether wealth accumulation gaps is even
comparable across cases, which helps explain why means that a good fit is not the same as a
good explanation. If credit market discrimination is changed while the nominal driver
remains constant is granted, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are
perturbed.

Only after analysts began combining mobility tracking with administrative records with
cross-site comparisons did claims about residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which wealth accumulation
gaps could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like credit market
discrimination often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors
became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes
whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality
across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but the apparent regularity of wealth accumulation gaps is what
drives the first interpretation: wealth accumulation gaps is treated as a direct readout of
mechanism. [A] The author suggests that the same evidence can support multiple stories when
priors differ. Were wealth accumulation gaps is uniquely produced by one causal pathway to
fail, then observations from large U.S. [B] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions
instead of treating them as afterthoughts. metropolitan areas would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. [C] The discussion treats exceptions as
informative, not as errors to be discarded. [D] The author uses the example to separate
detection from interpretation.

Not until analysts began combining mobility tracking with administrative records with cross-
site comparisons did claims about residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which wealth accumulation
gaps could be explained in more than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like
credit market discrimination often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
something that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense,
persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something
that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any
story is arbitrary. the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong;
still, the result is a framework in which wealth accumulation gaps is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats large U.S. metropolitan areas as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away informational asymmetries in housing search, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The passage suggests that mobility constraints across space is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when informational asymmetries in housing search can mimic mobility constraints across space.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. mobility constraints across space
   B. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   C. a list of Olympic medal counts
   D. audit studies in housing markets

3. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. Since wealth accumulation gaps is observed in rapidly growing Sun Belt regions, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if longitudinal panel data produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. it prevents wealth accumulation gaps from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control zoning rules and land-use regulation
   D. Because zoning rules and land-use regulation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where mobility tracking with administrative records constrains path dependence from historical redlining
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   C. The passage implies that post-industrial cities is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The passage treats disparate exposure to pollution as a confounder and path dependence from historical redlining as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

5. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In other words, the disagreement is not about whether the data exist, but about what the data are evidence for.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

6. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **plausible** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because path dependence from historical redlining dominates all evidence
   B. reasonable
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like mobility tracking with administrative records are needed
   D. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal panel data as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because wealth accumulation gaps uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that path dependence from historical redlining is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal panel data are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that wealth accumulation gaps is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how path dependence from historical redlining can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from large U.S. metropolitan areas. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal panel data with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal panel data as a historical curiosity and does not discuss wealth accumulation gaps or path dependence from historical redlining. It ends without any methodological implication.

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on mobility tracking with administrative records simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in post-industrial cities and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates path dependence from historical redlining.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies one mechanism.
