Passage 0578: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 800)

In classic laboratory tasks, the passage argues that researchers have treated devaluation of
rejected alternatives as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. To be sure, meta-analytic synthesis can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, yet the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—devaluation of rejected alternatives—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with
confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat devaluation of rejected alternatives as an
endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. In this
sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—devaluation of
rejected alternatives—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat devaluation of rejected alternatives as an endpoint
may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is scientifically revealing.

Not the obvious explanation but the apparent regularity of devaluation of rejected
alternatives is what drives the first interpretation: devaluation of rejected alternatives
is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. [A] Later comparisons reveal why this matters.
If devaluation of rejected alternatives is uniquely produced by one causal pathway holds,
then observations from workplace decision settings would be transferable, and disagreement
would be largely technical. [B] The author suggests that the same evidence can support
multiple stories when priors differ. the literature is full of such claims, not because the
caveat that self-concept threat might reproduce the same pattern, but because the
assumptions differ. [C] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat occurred
when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which meta-analytic synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In
this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike workplace decision settings. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because self-concept
threat shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. the author therefore
separates detection from interpretation, not because treating devaluation of rejected
alternatives as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which meta-analytic synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic;
nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to
admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary. Even if the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer
is strong, the result is a framework in which devaluation of rejected alternatives is
interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting implicit association tests as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats implicit association tests as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining implicit association tests with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using implicit association tests are unnecessary.

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **convergent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like meta-analytic synthesis are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because self-concept threat dominates all evidence
   C. coming together
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage suggests that increased liking for chosen options is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when self-concept threat can mimic increased liking for chosen options.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving behavioral priming designs.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away self-concept threat, since variability is merely a measurement error.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on longitudinal attitude surveys simple.

   B. devaluation of rejected alternatives specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. choice-induced preference paradigms as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. The discussion suggests that measurement reactivity is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The passage treats increased liking for chosen options as a confounder and measurement reactivity as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The author argues that choice-induced preference paradigms should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

10. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. it prevents devaluation of rejected alternatives from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
   B. Since devaluation of rejected alternatives is observed in workplace decision settings, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if behavioral priming designs produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. The passage implies that behavioral priming designs directly measures causes, meaning confounding from public versus private commitment is impossible.
