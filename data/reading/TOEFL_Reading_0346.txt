Passage 0346: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 779)

Under expanded parameter sweeps, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated rate
enhancement as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Although
in situ spectroscopy can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike automotive catalytic converters. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely
because catalyst deactivation shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. the
author therefore separates detection from interpretation—not treating rate enhancement as a
self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Hardly had analysts began combining in situ spectroscopy with cross-site comparisons
occurred when claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which rate enhancement could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like catalyst deactivation often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which
helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Not until analysts began combining in situ spectroscopy with cross-site comparisons was it
clear that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which rate enhancement could be explained in more than one way because, as
the author notes, confounders like catalyst deactivation often co-vary with the driver. as
the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. [A] This reasoning matters because it changes what
counts as a decisive test. If one wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then
the same observation—rate enhancement—must be paired with tests that change the conditions
under which it appears. [B] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance.
Whereas popular summaries treat rate enhancement as an endpoint in one account, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in
another. [C] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as
conditional. [D] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. In this sense, platinum-
catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst deactivation did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which in situ spectroscopy constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst deactivation did the
earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became empirically productive
rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which in situ spectroscopy constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. While it is true that the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which rate enhancement is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. rate enhancement specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. support interactions alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. microkinetic modeling as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because structure-sensitive activity uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in industrial hydrogenation reactors and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates adsorbate coverage effects.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on in situ spectroscopy simple.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like support interactions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting DFT surface modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that selectivity shifts is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how support interactions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from laboratory single-crystal studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining DFT surface modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats DFT surface modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selectivity shifts or support interactions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because selectivity shifts uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that support interactions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using DFT surface modeling are unnecessary.

4. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. Since poisoning by CO is observed in industrial hydrogenation reactors, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. Because catalyst deactivation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if surface microscopy produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. it prevents poisoning by CO from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control catalyst deactivation

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:

   C. structure-sensitive activity
   D. the length of the Nile in miles

7. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The discussion suggests that catalyst deactivation is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
