Passage 0751: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 654)

From a cognitive-control perspective, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated
selective memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization. Admittedly, choice-induced preference paradigms can make the
pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is
conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about
data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Not until analysts began combining choice-induced preference paradigms with cross-site
comparisons was it clear that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which selective memory for supporting
evidence could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like cultural
norms about consistency often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn,
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, post-choice attitude
change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation holds, then the same observation—selective memory for supporting
evidence—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an endpoint is
easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions.

Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A]
This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. by
comparing cases in which choice-induced preference paradigms constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The passage returns to this point
to clarify what counts as evidence. While it is true that a single case can be dramatic, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. [C] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be
discarded. [D] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. In this
sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Using choice-induced preference paradigms under stable conditions, the interpretation
shifts, and one frequently cited case from political opinion panels appeared to support the
direct-readout view. To be sure, the original fit looked visually decisive, yet later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in cultural norms about consistency altered the
baseline enough to mute or mimic selective memory for supporting evidence. the passage
treats this episode as diagnostic, which illustrates why boundary conditions must be
specified before generalization is attempted. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record
can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Admittedly, the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; nevertheless, the result
is a framework in which selective memory for supporting evidence is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The author argues that meta-analytic synthesis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The passage treats selective memory for supporting evidence as a confounder and self-concept threat as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where meta-analytic synthesis constrains self-concept threat
   D. The discussion suggests that self-concept threat is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

2. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic devaluation of rejected alternatives.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using longitudinal attitude surveys.
   C. The author treats workplace decision settings as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   D. The passage suggests that devaluation of rejected alternatives is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

3. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control self-concept threat
   B. Because shifted confidence judgments appears, the mechanism must be unique, so self-concept threat can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifted confidence judgments is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. The passage implies that meta-analytic synthesis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from self-concept threat is impossible.

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining behavioral priming designs with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting behavioral priming designs as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats behavioral priming designs as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using behavioral priming designs are unnecessary.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on choice-induced preference paradigms simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in workplace decision settings and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates public versus private commitment.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
