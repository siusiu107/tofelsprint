Passage 0541: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 711)

Under expanded parameter sweeps, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated selectivity shifts as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis
on platinum surfaces. Though temperature-programmed desorption can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Despite the fact that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
facet dependence can shift baselines, altering whether selectivity shifts is even comparable
across cases, a move that means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation. Were
facet dependence is changed while the nominal driver remains constant to fail, one should
expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In this sense, surface-mediated
catalysis on pt is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The point is not X but the apparent regularity of selectivity shifts; in that framing,
drives the first interpretation: selectivity shifts is treated as a direct readout of
mechanism. Unless selectivity shifts is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then
observations from automotive catalytic converters would be transferable, and disagreement
would be largely technical cannot be claimed with confidence. Rather than the caveat that
facet dependence might reproduce the same pattern, the passage emphasizes that the
literature is full of such claims.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—selectivity shifts—must be paired with tests
that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
selectivity shifts as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point
for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. In this sense, platinum-
catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Using temperature-programmed desorption under stable conditions, the passage suggests one
frequently cited case from automotive catalytic converters appeared to support the direct-
readout view. [A] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be
discarded. Even if the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis
showed that small shifts in facet dependence altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic
selectivity shifts. [B] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. the passage treats this
episode as diagnostic, which is precisely why illustrates why boundary conditions must be
specified before generalization is attempted. [C] This is why the author repeatedly
contrasts what is measured with what is inferred. [D] The author suggests that the same
evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ.

Rarely has it been the case that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions, at least
before analysts began combining temperature-programmed desorption with cross-site
comparisons. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which selectivity
shifts could be explained in more than one way because confounders like facet dependence
often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an
empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted that the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which selectivity shifts is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. The discussion suggests that support interactions is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'Pt-active-site chemistry' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   C. The passage implies that automotive catalytic converters is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where DFT surface modeling constrains support interactions

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on surface microscopy simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates adsorbate coverage effects.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in electrochemical interfaces and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because poisoning by CO uniquely identifies one mechanism.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats temperature-programmed desorption as a historical curiosity and does not discuss structure-sensitive activity or facet dependence. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because structure-sensitive activity uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that facet dependence is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using temperature-programmed desorption are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that structure-sensitive activity is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how facet dependence can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from laboratory single-crystal studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining temperature-programmed desorption with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   D. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like facet dependence make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting temperature-programmed desorption as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | temperature-programmed desorption | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | rate enhancement | Can be contaminated by background variability |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It makes facet dependence irrelevant.
   B. It replaces surface microscopy with intuition.
   C. Adds correlated noise
   D. Samples only part of the system

5. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when catalyst deactivation can mimic structure-sensitive activity.
   B. The author treats industrial hydrogenation reactors as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away catalyst deactivation, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving microkinetic modeling.

   A. the length of the Nile in miles
   B. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   C. surface microscopy
   D. structure-sensitive activity

7. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that model assumptions is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents rate enhancement from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control support interactions
   B. Because rate enhancement appears, the mechanism must be unique, so support interactions can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. Because support interactions co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once rate enhancement is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
