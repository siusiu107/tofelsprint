Passage 0779: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 764)

In policy discussions, researchers found that researchers have treated wealth accumulation
gaps as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality. Despite the fact that spatial autocorrelation analysis can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Only through analysts began combining spatial autocorrelation analysis with cross-site
comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. [A] The author implies that replication is informative
only when protocols are comparable. the goal was to break degeneracies in which wealth
accumulation gaps could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
informational asymmetries in housing search often co-vary with the driver, which is why
replication matters. [B] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to
be discarded. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. [C] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. [D]
This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline. In this sense,
spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on informational asymmetries in housing
search, the interpretation shifts, and many early studies framed residential segregation and
the persistence of neighborhood inequality as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those
studies emphasized wealth accumulation gaps as a signature in one account, later work asked
whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ in another. this
shift mattered for how evidence from rapidly growing Sun Belt regions was generalized
because, as the author notes, local conditions can change which processes generate wealth
accumulation gaps.

Though the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how informational
asymmetries in housing search can shift baselines, altering whether wealth accumulation gaps
is even comparable across cases, which means that a good fit is not the same as a good
explanation. Unless informational asymmetries in housing search is changed while the nominal
driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed
cannot be claimed with confidence. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality across
neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify informational asymmetries
in housing search was it defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive
rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which spatial autocorrelation analysis
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, a
move that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Despite
the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Were one
wishes to move from description to explanation to fail, then the same observation—wealth
accumulation gaps—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat wealth accumulation gaps as an endpoint looks
decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. In this sense, persistent
neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is
precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary. Even if the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer
is strong, the result is a framework in which wealth accumulation gaps is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. a recipe for bread fermentation
   B. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   C. audit studies in housing markets
   D. school-quality gradients

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **sparse** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Working with sparse records and limited controls on informational asymmetries in housing search, the interpretation shifts, and many early studies framed residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality as a single-mechanism phenomenon.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like audit studies in housing markets are needed
   B. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   C. thinly spread
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because zoning rules and land-use regulation dominates all evidence

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates informational asymmetries in housing search.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in large U.S. metropolitan areas and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on mobility tracking with administrative records simple.

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats audit studies in housing markets as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or zoning rules and land-use regulation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how zoning rules and land-use regulation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from large U.S. metropolitan areas. Finally, it maintains that tests combining audit studies in housing markets with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   C. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like zoning rules and land-use regulation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting audit studies in housing markets as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that zoning rules and land-use regulation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using audit studies in housing markets are unnecessary.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because zoning rules and land-use regulation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. Because mobility constraints across space appears, the mechanism must be unique, so zoning rules and land-use regulation can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if quasi-experimental policy evaluation produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. it prevents mobility constraints across space from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control zoning rules and land-use regulation

7. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving quasi-experimental policy evaluation.
   B. The author treats rapidly growing Sun Belt regions as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away path dependence from historical redlining, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when path dependence from historical redlining can mimic mobility constraints across space.

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where quasi-experimental policy evaluation constrains credit market discrimination
   B. The passage treats school-quality gradients as a confounder and credit market discrimination as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The passage implies that European migrant neighborhoods is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'urban sorting by race and income' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
