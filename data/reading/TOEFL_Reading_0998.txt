Passage 0998: Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments (Psychology)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 769)

In replication efforts, researchers found that researchers have treated reduced recall of
unpracticed items as the decisive sign of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory
experiments. process-dissociation procedures can make the pattern look unusually sharp;
still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives. The decisive factor is methodological humility;
once that is stated, the passage presents as the lesson of retrieval-induced forgetting in
memory experiments: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If
one wishes to move from description to explanation is granted, then the same
observation—reduced recall of unpracticed items—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat reduced recall of
unpracticed items as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts. In this sense, practice-driven suppression of
competing memories is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike classroom study settings. [A] This is presented
not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely because
encoding strength heterogeneity shifted the baseline in different directions across sites.
[B] The author suggests that the same evidence can support multiple stories when priors
differ. So the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, and so, too, does
the evidence undermine treating reduced recall of unpracticed items as a self-sufficient
conclusion. [C] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as
conditional. [D] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike classroom study settings. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed in part because
encoding strength heterogeneity shifted the baseline in different directions across sites.
The issue is not treating reduced recall of unpracticed items as a self-sufficient
conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. Only
after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify encoding strength heterogeneity
did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which process-dissociation
procedures constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this
sense, retrieval-based inhibition is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label. Not the obvious explanation but the apparent regularity of reduced recall of
unpracticed items is what drives the first interpretation: reduced recall of unpracticed
items is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. If reduced recall of unpracticed items is
uniquely produced by one causal pathway holds, then observations from classroom study
settings would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. Not the caveat
that encoding strength heterogeneity might reproduce the same pattern, but the literature is
full of such claims. If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and
therefore the passage presents as the lesson of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory
experiments: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Were one
wishes to move from description to explanation to fail, then the same observation—reduced
recall of unpracticed items—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which
it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat reduced recall of unpracticed items as an
endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental
or observational contrasts in another. In this sense, selective recall causing forgetting is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, the central
disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why
the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. The discussion suggests that test expectancy effects is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The passage treats strategy shifts over trials as a confounder and test expectancy effects as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where pre-registered replication constrains test expectancy effects
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'retrieval-based inhibition' refers to a different field altogether, not to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments.

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on paired-associate tasks simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates test expectancy effects.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-cultural replications and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because strategy shifts over trials uniquely identifies one mechanism.

3. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. Since context-dependent effects is observed in laboratory paradigms, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. The passage implies that recognition tests directly measures causes, meaning confounding from encoding strength heterogeneity is impossible.
   C. it prevents context-dependent effects from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control encoding strength heterogeneity
   D. Because context-dependent effects appears, the mechanism must be unique, so encoding strength heterogeneity can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving process-dissociation procedures.
   B. The author treats cross-cultural replications as a special case and argues that no broader inference about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments is possible.
   C. The passage suggests that reduced recall of unpracticed items is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when encoding strength heterogeneity can mimic reduced recall of unpracticed items.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **idiosyncratic** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
   A. peculiar to one case
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because encoding strength heterogeneity dominates all evidence
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like recognition tests are needed
   D. irrelevant to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments, serving only as background detail

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. recognition tests as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. stress modulation of recall alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. strategy shifts over trials specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments and argues that metacognitive illusions is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how encoding strength heterogeneity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-cultural replications. Finally, it maintains that tests combining process-dissociation procedures with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about practice-driven suppression of competing memories robust.
   B. The passage argues that selective recall causing forgetting cannot be studied empirically because confounders like encoding strength heterogeneity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting process-dissociation procedures as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats process-dissociation procedures as a historical curiosity and does not discuss metacognitive illusions or encoding strength heterogeneity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that retrieval-based inhibition is settled because metacognitive illusions uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that encoding strength heterogeneity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using process-dissociation procedures are unnecessary.

8. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. recognition tests
   B. Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments
   C. context-dependent effects
   D. the author’s favorite color

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
