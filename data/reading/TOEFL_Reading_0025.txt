Passage 0025: The Meissner Effect and Why Superconductors Redraw Magnetism (Physics)
====================================================================================
(Word count: 610)

A superconductor is sometimes described as a material with “zero resistance,” but that
description misses the feature that makes superconductivity unmistakable: a superconductor
expels magnetic fields from its interior. This expulsion, known as the Meissner effect,
shows that superconductivity is not merely perfect conductivity; it is a distinct phase of
matter with its own electromagnetic behavior. If a piece of metal were simply an ideal
conductor, it would trap whatever magnetic field was present when it became ideal. A
superconductor, by contrast, actively pushes the field out as it enters the superconducting
state, leaving only a thin boundary layer where the field can penetrate.

The effect arises from how charges move collectively. In ordinary metals, electrons scatter
off lattice vibrations and defects, producing resistance. In a superconductor, electrons
form paired states that behave coherently, allowing current to flow without dissipation.
More importantly for magnetism, the paired condensate responds to a magnetic field by
generating screening currents near the surface. Those currents create a magnetic field that
opposes the applied one, cancelling it inside. [A] The cancellation is not achieved by
individual electrons choosing clever paths; it is a bulk response, like a fluid adjusting to
maintain equilibrium.

Field expulsion explains levitation demonstrations. When a magnet is placed above a cooled
superconductor, the superconductor’s screening currents create a repulsive interaction. The
magnet can hover because the system settles into a configuration where magnetic energy is
minimized. If the superconductor is of a type that pins magnetic flux lines— allowing some
field to enter in quantized vortices that are trapped by imperfections—the levitation can be
remarkably stable. A magnet can appear “locked” in space, resisting sideways motion, because
moving it would require moving pinned vortices through the material, which costs energy.

Not all superconductors behave identically. Type I superconductors expel magnetic fields
completely until a critical field is reached, at which point superconductivity collapses.
Type II superconductors, more common in technological applications, allow partial
penetration above a lower critical field through vortices while maintaining
superconductivity up to a higher critical field. [B] The distinction matters for magnets.
High-field applications, such as MRI machines, require materials that remain superconducting
under strong fields, making Type II behavior essential.

Temperature is the gatekeeper. Below a critical temperature, the paired state is
energetically favored; above it, thermal motion disrupts pairing and ordinary resistance
returns. The details of pairing vary. In conventional superconductors, lattice vibrations
help bind electrons into pairs. In some unconventional materials, the binding mechanism is
less clear, and the critical temperatures can be much higher. Regardless of mechanism, the
Meissner effect remains diagnostic: when the material becomes superconducting, magnetism
inside changes abruptly.

The Meissner effect also clarifies why superconducting circuits can store persistent
currents. Because the interior is field-free and resistance-free, a current can circulate
without decaying for extremely long times, limited mainly by external disturbances. [C] Such
persistence enables sensitive detectors and quantum devices, but it also imposes design
constraints: shielding, cooling, and careful control of fields are needed to keep the
superconducting state intact.

Thus, superconductivity is not simply “a better wire.” It is a phase that reorganizes how
charges and fields coexist. [D] By expelling magnetic fields through collective screening
currents, a superconductor reveals that electrical perfection and magnetic behavior are
inseparable, and that the most visible consequence of a microscopic pairing transition can
be a macroscopic change in how space around the material is shaped by magnetism.

A related concept is the London penetration depth, which sets how far an external field can
leak into the surface layer. In very clean samples this depth and the quantization of flux
help distinguish true superconducting expulsion from mere low-resistance behavior.


Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author emphasize the Meissner effect rather than only zero resistance?
   A. To show that superconductivity is a distinct phase that actively changes magnetic behavior, not merely perfect conduction

   A. serving as a clear indicator
   B. made of diagnosis machines
   C. accidental and rare
