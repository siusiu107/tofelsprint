Passage 0025: The Meissner Effect and Why Superconductors Redraw Magnetism (Physics)
====================================================================================
(Word count: 610)

A superconductor is sometimes described as a material with “zero resistance,” but that
description misses the feature that makes superconductivity unmistakable: a superconductor
expels magnetic fields from its interior. This expulsion, known as the Meissner effect,
shows that superconductivity is not merely perfect conductivity; it is a distinct phase of
matter with its own electromagnetic behavior. If a piece of metal were simply an ideal
conductor, it would trap whatever magnetic field was present when it became ideal. A
superconductor, by contrast, actively pushes the field out as it enters the superconducting
state, leaving only a thin boundary layer where the field can penetrate.

The effect arises from how charges move collectively. In ordinary metals, electrons scatter
off lattice vibrations and defects, producing resistance. In a superconductor, electrons
form paired states that behave coherently, allowing current to flow without dissipation.
More importantly for magnetism, the paired condensate responds to a magnetic field by
generating screening currents near the surface. Those currents create a magnetic field that
opposes the applied one, cancelling it inside. [A] The cancellation is not achieved by
individual electrons choosing clever paths; it is a bulk response, like a fluid adjusting to
maintain equilibrium.

Field expulsion explains levitation demonstrations. When a magnet is placed above a cooled
superconductor, the superconductor’s screening currents create a repulsive interaction. The
magnet can hover because the system settles into a configuration where magnetic energy is
minimized. If the superconductor is of a type that pins magnetic flux lines— allowing some
field to enter in quantized vortices that are trapped by imperfections—the levitation can be
remarkably stable. A magnet can appear “locked” in space, resisting sideways motion, because
moving it would require moving pinned vortices through the material, which costs energy.

Not all superconductors behave identically. Type I superconductors expel magnetic fields
completely until a critical field is reached, at which point superconductivity collapses.
Type II superconductors, more common in technological applications, allow partial
penetration above a lower critical field through vortices while maintaining
superconductivity up to a higher critical field. [B] The distinction matters for magnets.
High-field applications, such as MRI machines, require materials that remain superconducting
under strong fields, making Type II behavior essential.

Temperature is the gatekeeper. Below a critical temperature, the paired state is
energetically favored; above it, thermal motion disrupts pairing and ordinary resistance
returns. The details of pairing vary. In conventional superconductors, lattice vibrations
help bind electrons into pairs. In some unconventional materials, the binding mechanism is
less clear, and the critical temperatures can be much higher. Regardless of mechanism, the
Meissner effect remains diagnostic: when the material becomes superconducting, magnetism
inside changes abruptly.

The Meissner effect also clarifies why superconducting circuits can store persistent
currents. Because the interior is field-free and resistance-free, a current can circulate
without decaying for extremely long times, limited mainly by external disturbances. [C] Such
persistence enables sensitive detectors and quantum devices, but it also imposes design
constraints: shielding, cooling, and careful control of fields are needed to keep the
superconducting state intact.

Thus, superconductivity is not simply “a better wire.” It is a phase that reorganizes how
charges and fields coexist. [D] By expelling magnetic fields through collective screening
currents, a superconductor reveals that electrical perfection and magnetic behavior are
inseparable, and that the most visible consequence of a microscopic pairing transition can
be a macroscopic change in how space around the material is shaped by magnetism.

A related concept is the London penetration depth, which sets how far an external field can
leak into the surface layer. In very clean samples this depth and the quantization of flux
help distinguish true superconducting expulsion from mere low-resistance behavior.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] By expelling magnetic fields through collective screening currents, a superconductor reveals that electrical perfection and magnetic behavior are inseparable, and that the most visible consequence of a microscopic pairing transition can be a macroscopic change in how space around the material is shaped by magnetism.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across fields
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to magnetic and superconductor
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of fields

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains field by linking magnetic to superconductor, and it shows why fields changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage concedes that magnetic is often incomplete and concludes that field cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since fields overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of superconductor with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, under the stated assumptions.
   C. The passage presents superconductor as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once magnetic is observed, competing explanations for field collapse. It treats fields as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   D. The passage surveys field but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed superconductor first, with magnetic serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats fields as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how field should change if fields is altered, instead of assuming that magnetic has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to superconductor must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in fields, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of magnetic is enough to validate superconductor for field.
   C. The passage implies that fields mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes magnetic effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of superconductor no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain field, especially regarding magnetic.
   D. The passage treats magnetic primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over superconductor are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about field are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, especially regarding superconductor, especially regarding field.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of sediment provenance as a factor influencing magnetic
   B. discussion of fields as a factor influencing magnetic, especially regarding magnetic.
   C. discussion of field as a factor influencing magnetic
   D. discussion of superconductor as a factor influencing magnetic

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] By expelling magnetic fields through collective screening currents, a superconductor reveals that electrical perfection and magnetic behavior are inseparable, and that the most visible consequence of a microscopic pairing transition can be a macroscopic change in how space around the material is shaped by magnetism.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   C. [D] By expelling magnetic fields through collective screening currents. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   D. [D] By expelling magnetic fields through collective screening currents. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of superconductor guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in fields are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because comparability prevents superconductor from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold fields constant while examining magnetic.
   C. Because once magnetic fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and fields can be ignored without changing conclusions about field.
   D. Because magnetic directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding field.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | magnetic | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | fields | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It proves superconductor is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that field should be read alongside fields, because magnetic alone does not settle what superconductor means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This expulsion, known as the Meissner effect, shows that superconductivity is not merely perfect conductivity; it is a distinct phase of matter with its own electromagnetic behavior.
   A. the preceding claim that fields alone explains the outcome of field
   B. the preceding claim about how magnetic is interpreted in relation to superconductor
   C. the preceding claim that field functions as a direct measurement of superconductor
   D. the preceding claim that magnetic is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of magnetic and superconductor should be abandoned altogether.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses superconductor, so debate over magnetic is unnecessary noise, especially regarding fields, especially regarding superconductor.
   C. to show that the term field belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of magnetic lead to different conclusions about field.
