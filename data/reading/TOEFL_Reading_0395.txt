Passage 0395: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 752)

Across multiple northern cities, one sees why researchers have treated shifts in industrial
labor demand as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban transformation.
Admittedly, labor market inference from wage series can make the pattern look unusually
sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, it becomes plausible that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike Detroit. the same summary statistic could
be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely because racial violence and
intimidation shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. Rather than treating
shifts in industrial labor demand as a self-sufficient conclusion, the passage emphasizes
that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense, african
american internal migration is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—shifts in industrial labor demand—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat shifts in industrial labor demand as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes
more predictive under replication.

Only when analysts began combining labor market inference from wage series with cross-site
comparisons did claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which shifts in industrial labor demand could be explained in more
than one way largely because confounders like racial violence and intimidation often co-vary
with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify racial violence and
intimidation could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically productive rather
than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which labor market inference from wage series
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample,
which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify racial violence and
intimidation occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. [A] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
by comparing cases in which labor market inference from wage series constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, a move that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] This reasoning matters
because it changes what counts as a decisive test. Although a single case can be dramatic,
the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. [C] The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols
are comparable. [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Admittedly, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong;
nevertheless, the result is a framework in which shifts in industrial labor demand is
interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The discussion suggests that housing covenants and policy constraints is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where census microdata analysis constrains housing covenants and policy constraints
   C. The author argues that census microdata analysis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'South-to-North population movement' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conspicuous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like oral history synthesis are needed
   B. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   C. easy to notice
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because housing covenants and policy constraints dominates all evidence

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In short, the passage treats methodological humility as a strength, not as an admission of ignorance.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats Detroit as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away push–pull dynamics, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving census microdata analysis.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when push–pull dynamics can mimic shifts in industrial labor demand.

5. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the price of coal in 1700
   B. segregation and redlining signatures
   C. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   D. newspaper archive research

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. newspaper archive research as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. shifts in industrial labor demand specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. wartime industry demand alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats newspaper archive research as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifts in industrial labor demand or racial violence and intimidation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that shifts in industrial labor demand is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how racial violence and intimidation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Detroit. Finally, it maintains that tests combining newspaper archive research with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   C. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that racial violence and intimidation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using newspaper archive research are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like racial violence and intimidation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting newspaper archive research as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that boundary conditions is important mainly because:
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once changes in neighborhood composition is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Because changes in neighborhood composition appears, the mechanism must be unique, so racial violence and intimidation can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. it prevents changes in neighborhood composition from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control racial violence and intimidation
   D. Because racial violence and intimidation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

9. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | oral history synthesis | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | shifts in industrial labor demand | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | housing covenants and policy constraints | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Samples only part of the system
   B. It proves segregation and redlining signatures is unique.
   C. It makes wartime industry demand irrelevant.
   D. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices

10. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Chicago and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates housing covenants and policy constraints.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on census microdata analysis simple.
