Passage 0419: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 763)

When temperature anomalies cluster, one sees why researchers have treated changes in reef
fish assemblages as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves.
Although photophysiology measurements can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage
argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives. Using photophysiology measurements under stable conditions, it is
difficult to deny that one frequently cited case from the Great Barrier Reef appeared to
support the direct-readout view. [A] The author implies that replication is informative only
when protocols are comparable. Even if the original fit looked visually decisive, later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in compound stressors such as acidification and
pollution altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic changes in reef fish assemblages. [B]
At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. the
passage treats this episode as diagnostic, an outcome that illustrates why boundary
conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. [C] The passage highlights
that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. [D] The discussion treats
exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. In this sense, thermal bleaching
events is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Using
photophysiology measurements under stable conditions, the passage suggests one frequently
cited case from the Great Barrier Reef appeared to support the direct-readout view. Although
the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small
shifts in compound stressors such as acidification and pollution altered the baseline enough
to mute or mimic changes in reef fish assemblages. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, which illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted. Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify
compound stressors such as acidification and pollution was the field forced to accept that
the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases
in which photophysiology measurements constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
Seldom, prior to analysts began combining photophysiology measurements with cross-site
comparisons, did investigators concede that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
the goal was to break degeneracies in which changes in reef fish assemblages could be
explained in more than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like compound
stressors such as acidification and pollution often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
something that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, loss of
symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label. It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson
of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what competing
models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to explanation be
true, then the same observation—changes in reef fish assemblages—must be paired with tests
that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat changes
in reef fish assemblages as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting
point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under
replication. Working with sparse records and limited controls on compound stressors such as
acidification and pollution, the key question becomes whether many early studies framed
coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas
those studies emphasized changes in reef fish assemblages as a signature looks decisive,
later work asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ
becomes more predictive under replication. this shift mattered for how evidence from the
Great Barrier Reef was generalized because local conditions can change which processes
generate changes in reef fish assemblages, which is why replication matters. In this sense,
reef-scale bleaching episodes is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label. In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most
informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like satellite thermal stress maps are needed
   B. irrelevant to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves, serving only as background detail
   C. unclear
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because disease outbreaks dominates all evidence

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: the goal was to break degeneracies in which changes in reef fish assemblages could be explained in more than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like compound stressors such as acidification and pollution often co-vary with the driver.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifts in carbonate accretion uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Coral Triangle and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates compound stressors such as acidification and pollution.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on degree-heating-week metrics simple.

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Using photophysiology measurements under stable conditions, it is difficult to deny that one frequently cited case from the Great Barrier Reef appeared to support the direct-readout view.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. recruitment failure specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. symbiont genotyping as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. symbiont clade switching alone, treated as the sole cause

4. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving reef-scale temperature loggers.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when local adaptation can mimic mortality and phase shifts.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away local adaptation, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using reef-scale temperature loggers.

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The passage implies that Caribbean reef tracts is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author argues that degree-heating-week metrics should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress' refers to a different field altogether, not to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where degree-heating-week metrics constrains compound stressors such as acidification and pollution

6. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | satellite thermal stress maps | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | changes in reef fish assemblages | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | compound stressors such as acidification and pollution | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It makes compound stressors such as acidification and pollution irrelevant.
   B. May not generalize across contexts
   C. It replaces photophysiology measurements with intuition.
   D. It proves recruitment failure is unique.

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because shifts in carbonate accretion uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that symbiont clade switching is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using reef-scale temperature loggers are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats reef-scale temperature loggers as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifts in carbonate accretion or symbiont clade switching. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that shifts in carbonate accretion is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how symbiont clade switching can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Caribbean reef tracts. Finally, it maintains that tests combining reef-scale temperature loggers with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   D. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like symbiont clade switching make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting reef-scale temperature loggers as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. Since shifts in carbonate accretion is observed in Red Sea reefs, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifts in carbonate accretion is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. Because disease outbreaks co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. it prevents shifts in carbonate accretion from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control disease outbreaks

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves
   B. the author’s favorite color
   C. recruitment failure
   D. reef-scale temperature loggers

10. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the inference is underdetermined, the most informative tests are those that break degeneracies rather than those that merely sharpen one feature.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]
