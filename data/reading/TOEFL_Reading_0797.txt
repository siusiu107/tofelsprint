Passage 0797: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 658)

From an observational standpoint, the passage argues that researchers have treated apparent
slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in
transit spectroscopy. Although simultaneous photometric monitoring can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify limb-darkening model mismatch
did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] The passage
highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. by comparing cases in
which simultaneous photometric monitoring constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author suggests that
the same evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ. Despite the fact that a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. [C] The author uses the detour to show why a
different metric would lead to a different conclusion. [D] At first glance, the pattern
seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. In this sense, unocculted
spot/facula bias in transit data is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Only when analysts began combining simultaneous photometric monitoring with cross-site
comparisons did claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying
on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering could be explained in
more than one way because confounders like limb-darkening model mismatch often co-vary with
the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable.

In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike active K-dwarf
host stars. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms
differed because limb-darkening model mismatch shifted the baseline in different directions
across sites. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because
treating apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as a self-sufficient conclusion, but
because the assumptions differ. In this sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from
description to explanation be true, then the same observation—apparent slopes mimicking
Rayleigh scattering—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as an
endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. In this
sense, photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. the temptation to treat
a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; still, the result is a framework in which
apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because limb-darkening model mismatch dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like multi-epoch transit campaigns are needed
   D. unclear

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on multi-epoch transit campaigns simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates starspot temperature contrasts.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because rotation-modulated light curves uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in active K-dwarf host stars and everywhere else.

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional.
   A. starspot temperature contrasts alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. rotation-modulated light curves specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. spot–facular forward modeling as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The author argues that chromatic transit analysis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The passage implies that bright nearby planet hosts is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The discussion suggests that starspot temperature contrasts is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where chromatic transit analysis constrains starspot temperature contrasts

5. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   B. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy
   C. chromatic transit analysis
   D. rotation-modulated light curves

7. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once spurious molecular detections is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. it prevents spurious molecular detections from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control instrument drift across visits
   C. The passage implies that chromatic transit analysis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from instrument drift across visits is impossible.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if chromatic transit analysis produces a tight fit on one dataset.

8. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | multi-epoch transit campaigns | Depends on modeling priors |

   C. Depends on modeling priors
   D. It makes instrument drift across visits irrelevant.

9. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving simultaneous photometric monitoring.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when limb-darkening model mismatch can mimic time-variable spectral baselines.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away limb-darkening model mismatch, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using simultaneous photometric monitoring.

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that rotation-modulated light curves is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how limb-darkening model mismatch can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from multi-epoch JWST targets. Finally, it maintains that tests combining spot–facular forward modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats spot–facular forward modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rotation-modulated light curves or limb-darkening model mismatch. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because rotation-modulated light curves uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that limb-darkening model mismatch is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using spot–facular forward modeling are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like limb-darkening model mismatch make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting spot–facular forward modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
