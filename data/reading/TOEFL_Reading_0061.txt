Passage 0061: Loess Layers, Paleosols, and the Dust Archive of Monsoon History (Geology)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 608)

In northern China, winds have written a climate archive in dust. Over hundreds of thousands
of years, storms sweeping across dry basins lifted fine silt and carried it eastward,
dropping it in thick blankets known as loess. The Chinese Loess Plateau, with its steep
gullies and sheer, yellow cliffs, is therefore not merely a landscape; it is a layered
record of how aridity, wind strength, and vegetation have fluctuated through glacial and
interglacial cycles.

Loess is distinctive because of how it is deposited. The grains are typically silt-sized,
angular enough to interlock, and porous enough to stand in near-vertical walls when dry.
During colder, drier periods, sparse vegetation leaves surfaces bare, and stronger winter
monsoon winds transport larger quantities of dust. During warmer, wetter periods, soils
develop within the loess, producing darker horizons called paleosols. These paleosols
contain more clay, more organic matter, and more evidence of biological activity, which
collectively suggest that rainfall and plant cover increased. [A] The alternation of bright
loess layers and darker soil layers can thus be read as a repeated switching between dust
accumulation and soil formation.

Yet interpreting the archive is more involved than matching color to climate. A loess layer
records not only how much dust fell but also where it came from and how it was transported.
Grain-size distributions, for example, are often used as a proxy for wind strength: coarser
silt implies more energetic transport, while finer material can indicate weaker winds or
longer transport distances. However, the same grain size can be produced by changes in
source sediment, not only by changes in wind. If an upwind basin becomes wetter and binds
its surfaces, the dust supply may shrink even if winds remain strong. [B] Thus, what looks
like a “wind signal” may partly be a “source availability signal.”

Magnetic properties add another layer of evidence. In many loess sequences, magnetic
susceptibility increases in paleosols. The explanation is chemical: during soil formation,
repeated wetting and drying can create tiny magnetic minerals, so a wetter interval can
leave a stronger magnetic imprint. Researchers therefore combine grain size, magnetism, and
geochemistry to separate transport from soil processes. They also compare multiple sites. If
distant sites show the same timing, a regional climate driver becomes more plausible than a
local landslide or a river’s shifting course.

Dating is the next challenge. Loess lacks the obvious annual layers of lake varves, and
organic material is not always preserved. Radiocarbon can date relatively young sections
when charcoal exists, but older deposits require other tools. Optically stimulated
luminescence (OSL) is widely used: quartz grains store energy from background radiation, and
exposure to sunlight resets that “clock.” By measuring how much energy has accumulated since
burial, OSL can estimate when the grain was last exposed to light, approximating the time of
deposition. [C] Yet OSL assumes that grains were sufficiently bleached during transport; if
dust traveled at night or was shielded in aggregates, the reset may be incomplete and the
age may appear older.

Despite these uncertainties, loess sequences have become central to reconstructing monsoon
history. When paleosols strengthen, inferences about intensified summer monsoon rainfall
often follow; when thick loess accumulates, intensified winter winds and aridity are
inferred. The record has also been linked to ice-volume changes and orbital cycles. In this
way, a cliff of dust becomes a bridge between local landscapes and global climate forcing.

Loess is therefore both generous and deceptive. It accumulates widely, preserving long
sequences, yet it encodes multiple processes at once. [D] Reading it well requires treating
each layer not as a single message, but as a composite written by wind, source terrain, soil
chemistry, and time.


Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word “proxy” is closest in meaning to:
   A. an indirect indicator used to infer another variable
   B. a dust storm of unusually long duration
   C. a chemical that bleaches quartz grains
   D. a deeply eroded gully

2. [Factual] According to the passage, what is a paleosol in the Loess Plateau record?
   A. a soil horizon that formed within loess during warmer, wetter intervals
   B. a layer of volcanic ash deposited by eruptions
   C. a river gravel bed indicating flooding
   D. a modern topsoil disturbed by agriculture only

3. [Inference] What can be inferred about why grain size alone may not reliably indicate wind strength?
   A. Changes in dust-source availability can alter grain-size distributions even if winds do not change
   B. Wind strength has no impact on transport of silt-sized particles
   C. Loess grains always come from the same source basin
   D. Grain size is determined only by soil chemistry after deposition

4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In other words, the archive contains intertwined stories of transport dynamics and landscape conditions upwind.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following dating approaches are mentioned EXCEPT:
   A. radiocarbon dating of charcoal
   B. optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) on quartz grains
   C. annual varve counting in lakes
   D. tree-ring cross-dating of loess layers

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author explain the assumptions behind OSL dating?
   A. To show why ages can be biased if grains were not fully reset by sunlight during transport
   B. To argue that loess cannot be dated by any method
   C. To compare OSL with magnetic susceptibility as a wind proxy
   D. To describe how paleosols become darker in color

7. [Reference] In the passage, “that ‘clock’” refers to:
   A. stored energy in quartz grains that accumulates from background radiation
   B. the seasonal timing of monsoon winds
   C. a mechanical device used in field camps
   D. orbital cycles that move Earth closer to the Sun

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces loess as a climate archive, explains layer alternation, then discusses interpretive complications, multiple proxies, dating challenges, and broader climate significance
   B. It lists sediment types without linking them to climate
   C. It describes only gully erosion and ignores loess layers
   D. It argues that all loess records are identical worldwide

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that loess is “generous and deceptive”?
   A. Loess preserves long sequences, but each layer reflects several processes at once, so interpretation requires caution
   B. Loess is rare, and its layers always record one variable perfectly
   C. Loess is useful only for archaeology, not for climate
   D. Loess cannot form soils because it is too porous

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Loess layers are deposited only by rivers, so they record flooding rather than wind or climate.
   B. The passage explains how loess–paleosol alternations on the Chinese Loess Plateau record shifts between dust deposition and soil formation, describes why grain size and magnetic signals can be ambiguous without considering source changes, and discusses dating with radiocarbon and OSL along with the assumptions needed to link the record to monsoon and global climate history.
   C. OSL dating provides exact annual layers comparable to tree rings.
   D. Paleosols form during the coldest, driest periods when vegetation is absent.
