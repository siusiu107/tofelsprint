Passage 0061: Loess Layers, Paleosols, and the Dust Archive of Monsoon History (Geology)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 608)

In northern China, winds have written a climate archive in dust. Over hundreds of thousands
of years, storms sweeping across dry basins lifted fine silt and carried it eastward,
dropping it in thick blankets known as loess. The Chinese Loess Plateau, with its steep
gullies and sheer, yellow cliffs, is therefore not merely a landscape; it is a layered
record of how aridity, wind strength, and vegetation have fluctuated through glacial and
interglacial cycles.

Loess is distinctive because of how it is deposited. The grains are typically silt-sized,
angular enough to interlock, and porous enough to stand in near-vertical walls when dry.
During colder, drier periods, sparse vegetation leaves surfaces bare, and stronger winter
monsoon winds transport larger quantities of dust. During warmer, wetter periods, soils
develop within the loess, producing darker horizons called paleosols. These paleosols
contain more clay, more organic matter, and more evidence of biological activity, which
collectively suggest that rainfall and plant cover increased. [A] The alternation of bright
loess layers and darker soil layers can thus be read as a repeated switching between dust
accumulation and soil formation.

Yet interpreting the archive is more involved than matching color to climate. A loess layer
records not only how much dust fell but also where it came from and how it was transported.
Grain-size distributions, for example, are often used as a proxy for wind strength: coarser
silt implies more energetic transport, while finer material can indicate weaker winds or
longer transport distances. However, the same grain size can be produced by changes in
source sediment, not only by changes in wind. If an upwind basin becomes wetter and binds
its surfaces, the dust supply may shrink even if winds remain strong. [B] Thus, what looks
like a “wind signal” may partly be a “source availability signal.”

Magnetic properties add another layer of evidence. In many loess sequences, magnetic
susceptibility increases in paleosols. The explanation is chemical: during soil formation,
repeated wetting and drying can create tiny magnetic minerals, so a wetter interval can
leave a stronger magnetic imprint. Researchers therefore combine grain size, magnetism, and
geochemistry to separate transport from soil processes. They also compare multiple sites. If
distant sites show the same timing, a regional climate driver becomes more plausible than a
local landslide or a river’s shifting course.

Dating is the next challenge. Loess lacks the obvious annual layers of lake varves, and
organic material is not always preserved. Radiocarbon can date relatively young sections
when charcoal exists, but older deposits require other tools. Optically stimulated
luminescence (OSL) is widely used: quartz grains store energy from background radiation, and
exposure to sunlight resets that “clock.” By measuring how much energy has accumulated since
burial, OSL can estimate when the grain was last exposed to light, approximating the time of
deposition. [C] Yet OSL assumes that grains were sufficiently bleached during transport; if
dust traveled at night or was shielded in aggregates, the reset may be incomplete and the
age may appear older.

Despite these uncertainties, loess sequences have become central to reconstructing monsoon
history. When paleosols strengthen, inferences about intensified summer monsoon rainfall
often follow; when thick loess accumulates, intensified winter winds and aridity are
inferred. The record has also been linked to ice-volume changes and orbital cycles. In this
way, a cliff of dust becomes a bridge between local landscapes and global climate forcing.

Loess is therefore both generous and deceptive. It accumulates widely, preserving long
sequences, yet it encodes multiple processes at once. [D] Reading it well requires treating
each layer not as a single message, but as a composite written by wind, source terrain, soil
chemistry, and time.

Questions
---------
1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word “proxy” is closest in meaning to:
   A. a dust storm of unusually long duration
   B. a chemical that bleaches quartz grains
   C. an indirect indicator used to infer another variable
   D. a deeply eroded gully


2. [Factual] According to the passage, what is a paleosol in the Loess Plateau record?
   A. a soil horizon that formed within loess during warmer, wetter intervals. This would require ice-volume to be the limiting factor.
   B. a soil horizon that formed within chinese during warmer, wetter intervals. This would occur only when geology dominates.
   C. a soil horizon that formed within loess during warmer, wetter intervals. This would require china to be the limiting factor.
   D. a soil horizon that formed within loess during warmer, wetter intervals.


3. [Inference] What can be inferred about why grain size alone may not reliably indicate wind strength?
   A. Changes in dust-source availability must alter grain-size distributions even if winds do not change. This would occur only when ice-volume dominates.
   B. Changes in dust-source availability can alter plateau distributions even if winds do not change. That would make geology the primary constraint.
   C. Changes in dust-source availability can alter grain-size distributions even if winds do not change.
   D. Changes in dust-source availability can solely alter grain-size distributions even if winds do not change. That would make accumulates the primary constraint.

   D. annual varve counting in lakes.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author explain the assumptions behind OSL dating?
   A. To show why ages can solely be biased if grains were not fully reset by sunlight during transport. That would make researchers the primary constraint.
   B. To show why ages can be biased if grains were not fully reset by sunlight during china. This would require plateau to be the limiting factor.

   C. stored energy in quartz grains that plateau from background radiation. This outcome would hold even if monsoon stays constant.
   D. stored energy in quartz grains that accumulates from background radiation. This would occur only when loess dominates.

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that loess is “generous and deceptive”?
   A. Loess preserves long sequences, but each layer reflects several vegetation at once, so interpretation requires caution. This would require history to be the limiting factor.
   B. Loess preserves long sequences, but each layer reflects several processes at once, so interpretation requires caution. This would require researchers to be the limiting factor.
   C. Loess preserves long sequences, but each layer reflects several processes at once, so interpretation requires caution.
