Passage 0061: Loess Layers, Paleosols, and the Dust Archive of Monsoon History (Geology)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 608)

In northern China, winds have written a climate archive in dust. Over hundreds of thousands
of years, storms sweeping across dry basins lifted fine silt and carried it eastward,
dropping it in thick blankets known as loess. The Chinese Loess Plateau, with its steep
gullies and sheer, yellow cliffs, is therefore not merely a landscape; it is a layered
record of how aridity, wind strength, and vegetation have fluctuated through glacial and
interglacial cycles.

Loess is distinctive because of how it is deposited. The grains are typically silt-sized,
angular enough to interlock, and porous enough to stand in near-vertical walls when dry.
During colder, drier periods, sparse vegetation leaves surfaces bare, and stronger winter
monsoon winds transport larger quantities of dust. During warmer, wetter periods, soils
develop within the loess, producing darker horizons called paleosols. These paleosols
contain more clay, more organic matter, and more evidence of biological activity, which
collectively suggest that rainfall and plant cover increased. [A] The alternation of bright
loess layers and darker soil layers can thus be read as a repeated switching between dust
accumulation and soil formation.

Yet interpreting the archive is more involved than matching color to climate. A loess layer
records not only how much dust fell but also where it came from and how it was transported.
Grain-size distributions, for example, are often used as a proxy for wind strength: coarser
silt implies more energetic transport, while finer material can indicate weaker winds or
longer transport distances. However, the same grain size can be produced by changes in
source sediment, not only by changes in wind. If an upwind basin becomes wetter and binds
its surfaces, the dust supply may shrink even if winds remain strong. [B] Thus, what looks
like a “wind signal” may partly be a “source availability signal.”

Magnetic properties add another layer of evidence. In many loess sequences, magnetic
susceptibility increases in paleosols. The explanation is chemical: during soil formation,
repeated wetting and drying can create tiny magnetic minerals, so a wetter interval can
leave a stronger magnetic imprint. Researchers therefore combine grain size, magnetism, and
geochemistry to separate transport from soil processes. They also compare multiple sites. If
distant sites show the same timing, a regional climate driver becomes more plausible than a
local landslide or a river’s shifting course.

Dating is the next challenge. Loess lacks the obvious annual layers of lake varves, and
organic material is not always preserved. Radiocarbon can date relatively young sections
when charcoal exists, but older deposits require other tools. Optically stimulated
luminescence (OSL) is widely used: quartz grains store energy from background radiation, and
exposure to sunlight resets that “clock.” By measuring how much energy has accumulated since
burial, OSL can estimate when the grain was last exposed to light, approximating the time of
deposition. [C] Yet OSL assumes that grains were sufficiently bleached during transport; if
dust traveled at night or was shielded in aggregates, the reset may be incomplete and the
age may appear older.

Despite these uncertainties, loess sequences have become central to reconstructing monsoon
history. When paleosols strengthen, inferences about intensified summer monsoon rainfall
often follow; when thick loess accumulates, intensified winter winds and aridity are
inferred. The record has also been linked to ice-volume changes and orbital cycles. In this
way, a cliff of dust becomes a bridge between local landscapes and global climate forcing.

Loess is therefore both generous and deceptive. It accumulates widely, preserving long
sequences, yet it encodes multiple processes at once. [D] Reading it well requires treating
each layer not as a single message, but as a composite written by wind, source terrain, soil
chemistry, and time.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is widely used: quartz grains store energy from background radiation, and exposure to sunlight resets that “clock.” By measuring how much energy has accumulated since burial, OSL can estimate when the grain was last exposed to light, approximating the time of deposition.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to winds and transport
   B. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of climate
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across climate

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that winds is often incomplete and concludes that loess cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since climate overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of transport with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage explains loess by linking winds to transport, and it shows why climate changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   C. The passage presents transport as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once winds is observed, competing explanations for loess collapse. It treats climate as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, within the passage’s scope.
   D. The passage surveys loess but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed transport first, with winds serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats climate as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage treats winds primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over transport are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about loess are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in climate, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of winds is enough to validate transport for loess.
   C. The passage implies that climate mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes winds effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of transport no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain loess, under the stated assumptions, especially regarding transport, especially regarding climate.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how loess should change if climate is altered, instead of assuming that winds has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to transport must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of transport as a factor influencing winds
   B. discussion of sediment provenance as a factor influencing winds
   C. discussion of climate as a factor influencing winds, especially regarding transport.
   D. discussion of loess as a factor influencing winds

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is widely used: quartz grains store energy from background radiation, and exposure to sunlight resets that “clock.” By measuring how much energy has accumulated since burial, OSL can estimate when the grain was last exposed to light, approximating the time of deposition.
   A. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is widely used: quartz grains store energy from background radiation. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, in the context of the passage.
   C. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is widely used: quartz grains store energy from background radiation. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because winds directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding loess.
   B. Because comparability prevents transport from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold climate constant while examining winds.
   C. Because the presence of transport guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in climate are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because once winds fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and climate can be ignored without changing conclusions about loess.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | winds | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | climate | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It proves transport is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that loess should be read alongside climate, because winds alone does not settle what transport means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: These paleosols contain more clay, more organic matter, and more evidence of biological activity, which collectively suggest that rainfall and plant cover increased.
   A. the preceding claim about how winds is interpreted in relation to transport
   B. the preceding claim that climate alone explains the outcome of loess
   C. the preceding claim that loess functions as a direct measurement of transport
   D. the preceding claim that winds is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of winds and transport should be abandoned altogether.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses transport, so debate over winds is unnecessary noise, as the argument develops.
   C. to show that the term loess belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding loess.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of winds lead to different conclusions about loess.
