Passage 0592: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 735)

When catalysts are benchmarked across labs, the central disagreement can be stated more
precisely: researchers have treated structure-sensitive activity as the decisive sign of
heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Though microkinetic modeling can make the
pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using microkinetic modeling under stable conditions, the interpretation shifts, and one
frequently cited case from automotive catalytic converters appeared to support the direct-
readout view. To be sure, the original fit looked visually decisive, yet later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in catalyst deactivation altered the baseline enough to
mute or mimic structure-sensitive activity. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic,
an outcome that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization
is attempted. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst deactivation
occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which microkinetic modeling constrains alternatives, researchers could
ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same
observation—structure-sensitive activity—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat structure-sensitive
activity as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. In
this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Only by analysts began combining microkinetic modeling with cross-site comparisons was the
field forced to accept that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which structure-sensitive activity could be explained in more
than one way because confounders like catalyst deactivation often co-vary with the driver,
which is why replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an
empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on catalyst deactivation, the argument
reframes the issue so that many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum
surfaces as a single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] The discussion makes clear that measurement
choices can masquerade as mechanism. Whereas those studies emphasized structure-sensitive
activity as a signature invites a tidy story, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ forces boundary conditions to be stated. [B] At
first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. this shift
mattered for how evidence from automotive catalytic converters was generalized because local
conditions can change which processes generate structure-sensitive activity, which is why
replication matters. [C] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather
than as an embarrassment. [D] The author notes that generalization requires more than a
single well-chosen case. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Although the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which structure-sensitive activity is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions
rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conditional** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Though microkinetic modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because adsorbate coverage effects dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like DFT surface modeling are needed
   C. dependent on conditions
   D. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail

2. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that structure-sensitive activity is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facet dependence can mimic structure-sensitive activity.
   C. The author treats automotive catalytic converters as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.

   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates facet dependence.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on temperature-programmed desorption simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in laboratory single-crystal studies and everywhere else.

   A. a recipe for bread fermentation
   B. in situ spectroscopy
   C. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   D. rate enhancement

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The discussion suggests that support interactions is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The passage treats rate enhancement as a confounder and support interactions as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like catalyst deactivation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting microkinetic modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that rate enhancement is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how catalyst deactivation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from industrial hydrogenation reactors. Finally, it maintains that tests combining microkinetic modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats microkinetic modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rate enhancement or catalyst deactivation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because rate enhancement uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that catalyst deactivation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using microkinetic modeling are unnecessary.

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
