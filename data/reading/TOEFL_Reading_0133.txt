Passage 0133: Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments (Psychology)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 737)

Despite seemingly clear effect sizes, researchers have treated strategy shifts over trials
as the decisive sign of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments. Granted that
pre-registered replication can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues
that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, a
move that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify test expectancy effects did
the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases
in which pre-registered replication constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. To be sure, a single case can be dramatic, yet the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, practice-driven suppression of competing memories is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—strategy shifts over trials—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat strategy shifts over trials as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes
more predictive under replication.

Never before analysts began combining pre-registered replication with cross-site comparisons
was it defensible to argue that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory
experiments stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. [A] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as
an embarrassment. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which
strategy shifts over trials could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
test expectancy effects often co-vary with the driver. [B] That point is not rhetorical; it
controls which prediction follows. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an
empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable. [C] The author suggests that the same evidence can support
multiple stories when priors differ. [D] The argument hinges on what would change under an
alternative explanation. In this sense, retrieval-based inhibition is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify test expectancy effects did
the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases
in which pre-registered replication constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative.

Not until analysts began combining pre-registered replication with cross-site comparisons
did claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which strategy shifts over trials could be explained in more than one way
largely because confounders like test expectancy effects often co-vary with the driver. as
the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice, which changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense,
selective recall causing forgetting is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Despite the fact that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer
is strong, the result is a framework in which strategy shifts over trials is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats paired-associate tasks as a historical curiosity and does not discuss strategy shifts over trials or encoding strength heterogeneity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments and argues that strategy shifts over trials is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how encoding strength heterogeneity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-cultural replications. Finally, it maintains that tests combining paired-associate tasks with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about practice-driven suppression of competing memories robust.
   C. The passage claims that retrieval-based inhibition is settled because strategy shifts over trials uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that encoding strength heterogeneity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using paired-associate tasks are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that selective recall causing forgetting cannot be studied empirically because confounders like encoding strength heterogeneity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting paired-associate tasks as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: As a result, the most valuable observations are often taken during transitions, when competing mechanisms diverge most clearly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize confounder control?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once reduced recall of unpracticed items is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Because stress modulation of recall co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. it prevents reduced recall of unpracticed items from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control stress modulation of recall
   D. Since reduced recall of unpracticed items is observed in clinical populations, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the price of coal in 1700
   B. recognition tests
   C. strategy shifts over trials
   D. Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on pre-registered replication simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in clinical populations and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates encoding strength heterogeneity.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because context-dependent effects uniquely identifies one mechanism.

6. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving pre-registered replication.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using pre-registered replication.
   C. The author treats clinical populations as a special case and argues that no broader inference about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments is possible.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when inhibitory control differences can mimic metacognitive illusions.

7. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. The author argues that fMRI pattern analysis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where fMRI pattern analysis constrains stress modulation of recall
   C. The discussion suggests that stress modulation of recall is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'selective recall causing forgetting' refers to a different field altogether, not to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments.
