Passage 0020: Gravitational Microlensing and a One-Time Window on Planets (Astronomy)
=====================================================================================
(Word count: 643)

Most exoplanets have been found by watching their stars dim or wobble, which means most
discoveries favor planets whose orbits are conveniently aligned or whose masses are large
enough to tug a star detectably. Gravitational microlensing finds planets through a
different route: it uses gravity itself as an optical instrument. When a foreground star
passes nearly in front of a background star, the foreground star’s gravity bends the
background light, magnifying it. If the alignment is close enough, the background star
brightens for days to weeks, producing a distinctive light curve. A planet orbiting the
foreground star can add a brief “blip” to that curve, revealing its presence even if the
planet never transits and even if the star’s motion is too small to measure precisely.

The underlying physics is rooted in general relativity, but the observable consequence is
practical. The magnification depends on how close the alignment is and on the mass of the
lensing star. For perfect alignment, the background light is distorted into a ring, but in
typical events, the ring is not resolved; it appears only as a brightening. The key is time
structure. A single-lens event rises smoothly and falls smoothly. When a planet contributes,
the curve can show a sharp deviation lasting hours to days, depending on the planet’s mass
and projected separation.

Microlensing is powerful because it is sensitive to planets at separations comparable to a
few astronomical units, where many planetary systems place ice-line planets. It can detect
planets that are relatively low mass, including those roughly Earth-mass in favorable cases,
and it can detect planets orbiting faint or distant stars in the Galactic bulge. [A] These
strengths come with constraints. Because the alignment is a chance geometry, the event is
typically not repeatable. Once the lens and source separate, the magnification ends, and the
same planet is unlikely to produce the same signal again for human observers.

This one-time nature changes what microlensing surveys emphasize. Rather than revisiting a
single star for periodic dips, they monitor crowded fields continuously, searching for rare
brightenings. The strategy resembles watching a stadium of fans for a single wave that might
happen in one section and then vanish. [B] When an event is detected, rapid follow-up
matters, because the planetary deviation can be brief and can be missed if observations
pause for a night or if clouds intervene. Consequently, networks of telescopes distributed
in longitude are valuable, allowing near-continuous coverage.

Interpreting a microlensing event also requires care because different lens configurations
can sometimes produce similar light-curve shapes. A small planet at one projected separation
can mimic a larger planet at another separation if the geometry differs. In many cases,
additional observations of the lens star years later—once it has moved away from the
source—can constrain its mass and distance, narrowing the planet’s inferred properties. Even
then, microlensing often yields statistical populations more readily than richly
characterized individual worlds.

For planet demographics, however, statistics are precisely the point. Because microlensing
samples a different region of parameter space than transits do, it can reveal whether cold
planets are common, whether super‑Earths beyond the ice line dominate, and how planet
frequency varies with stellar mass in dense Galactic environments. [C] In combination with
other methods, it helps complete a census that no single technique can provide.

Microlensing therefore illustrates a broader lesson about discovery. Each technique is a
filter: it highlights certain planets and obscures others. By exploiting gravity’s ability
to magnify light, microlensing makes visible planets that would otherwise remain hidden, not
because they are rare, but because other methods are blind to them. [D] The fleeting
brightening in a crowded star field, once decoded, becomes evidence that planetary systems
are scattered through the Galaxy in forms and places that would be easy to miss if one
looked only for periodic shadows.


Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, what produces the basic brightening in a microlensing event?
   A. Gravity from a foreground star bends and magnifies light from a background star during close alignment
   B. A planet blocks starlight directly, creating a transit dip
   C. A star ejects material that reflects light toward Earth
   D. A telescope resolves a visible ring in every event

2. [Vocabulary] The word “fleeting” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. brief
   B. predictable
   C. opaque
   D. immobile

3. [Inference] What can be inferred from the passage about why microlensing events are hard to repeat?
   A. They depend on rare chance alignments that end once the lens and source separate
   B. They require the planet to stop orbiting after one detection
   C. They depend on planets that emit their own visible light
   D. They can be repeated easily by pointing the telescope again the next night

4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: As a result, the method trades detailed follow-up of one system for the ability to sample many systems once.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as reasons follow-up networks are useful EXCEPT:
   A. planetary deviations can be brief and easily missed
   B. weather or nightfall can interrupt observations at one site
   C. telescopes at different longitudes can extend coverage
   D. the method requires continuous measurement of a star’s radial velocity wobble for decades

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author compare microlensing monitoring to watching a stadium for a single wave?
   A. To illustrate the need to monitor many stars for rare, transient brightenings
   B. To argue that microlensing works only in sports arenas
   C. To claim that transits are never periodic
   D. To suggest that microlensing signals always last for years

7. [Reference] In the passage, “this one-time nature” refers to the fact that:
   A. a microlensing alignment typically produces a non-repeating event for observers
   B. planets discovered by microlensing are destroyed afterward
   C. the background star disappears permanently
   D. only one planet exists in the Galaxy

8. [Organization] How does the passage develop its explanation of microlensing?
   A. By contrasting it with transit and wobble methods, explaining the light-curve signature, then describing observational strategy, interpretation limits, and demographic value
   B. By listing planetary names without explaining detection
   C. By focusing only on general relativity equations
   D. By describing telescope hardware without mentioning alignment

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that each detection technique is a “filter”?
   A. Different methods are sensitive to different kinds of planets, so combining methods reveals a fuller population
   B. All methods detect exactly the same planets with the same biases
   C. A technique’s results are independent of geometry and mass
   D. Microlensing detects only planets that transit

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Microlensing finds planets mainly by measuring periodic stellar dimming and is therefore best for close-in orbits.
   B. The passage explains microlensing as a chance alignment that magnifies a background star, with planets creating brief deviations; it notes the method’s one-time observational constraints and its strength in sampling cold planets and distant systems to complement other detection techniques.
   C. Microlensing provides detailed atmospheric measurements for each planet because events repeat regularly.
   D. Planetary deviations in microlensing always have unique interpretations with no degeneracy.
