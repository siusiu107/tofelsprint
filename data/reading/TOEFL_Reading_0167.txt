Passage 0167: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 745)

In classic laboratory tasks, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated increased
liking for chosen options as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. While it is true that behavioral priming designs can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike workplace decision settings. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely
because cultural norms about consistency shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation—not treating increased
liking for chosen options as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, post-choice
attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural
norms about consistency. by comparing cases in which behavioral priming designs constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. While it is true
that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—increased liking for chosen
options—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot
be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat increased liking for chosen
options as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions.
In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Not until analysts began combining behavioral priming designs with cross-site comparisons
was it clear that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. The
passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which increased liking for chosen
options could be explained in more than one way because confounders like cultural norms
about consistency often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes
whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A]
This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline. by comparing
cases in which behavioral priming designs constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author uses the detour to
show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. a single case can be
dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. [C] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing
on what the data cannot rule out. [D] The passage returns to this point to clarify what
counts as evidence. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted that the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which increased liking for chosen options is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting choice-induced preference paradigms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats choice-induced preference paradigms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifted confidence judgments or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using choice-induced preference paradigms are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that shifted confidence judgments is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining choice-induced preference paradigms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.

2. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. behavioral priming designs as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. measurement reactivity alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. devaluation of rejected alternatives specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **convergent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Granted that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which increased liking for chosen options is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.
   A. coming together
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because cultural norms about consistency dominates all evidence
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like meta-analytic synthesis are needed
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

   D. Samples only part of the system

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that model assumptions is important mainly because:
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifted confidence judgments is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Because shifted confidence judgments appears, the mechanism must be unique, so public versus private commitment can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if behavioral priming designs produces a tight fit on one dataset.

   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where choice-induced preference paradigms constrains measurement reactivity
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'post-choice attitude change' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   C. The author argues that choice-induced preference paradigms should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The discussion suggests that measurement reactivity is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
