Passage 0603: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 697)

In surface-science experiments, researchers have treated selectivity shifts as the decisive
sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Though microkinetic modeling can make
the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using microkinetic modeling under stable conditions, one frequently cited case from
laboratory single-crystal studies appeared to support the direct-readout view. Though the
original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts
in support interactions altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic selectivity shifts. the
passage treats this episode as diagnostic; this, in turn, illustrates why boundary
conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. In this sense, surface-
mediated catalysis on pt is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Despite the fact that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
support interactions can shift baselines, altering whether selectivity shifts is even
comparable across cases, which forces analysts to admit that means that a good fit is not
the same as a good explanation. If support interactions is changed while the nominal driver
remains constant holds, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed.

Hardly had analysts began combining microkinetic modeling with cross-site comparisons
occurred when claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which selectivity shifts could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like support interactions often co-vary with the driver, which is why
replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The point is not X but the apparent regularity of selectivity shifts; in that framing,
drives the first interpretation: selectivity shifts is treated as a direct readout of
mechanism. [A] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as
an embarrassment. Should selectivity shifts is uniquely produced by one causal pathway be
true, then observations from laboratory single-crystal studies would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. [B] The passage returns to this point to clarify
what counts as evidence. The issue is not the caveat that support interactions might
reproduce the same pattern; it is that the literature is full of such claims. [C] Later
comparisons reveal why this matters. [D] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide
degenerate explanations.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation
is granted, then the same observation—selectivity shifts—must be paired with tests that
change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat selectivity
shifts as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. In
this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; still, the result is a
framework in which selectivity shifts is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions
rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats DFT surface modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss poisoning by CO or adsorbate coverage effects. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like adsorbate coverage effects make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting DFT surface modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that poisoning by CO is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how adsorbate coverage effects can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from laboratory single-crystal studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining DFT surface modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   D. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because poisoning by CO uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that adsorbate coverage effects is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using DFT surface modeling are unnecessary.

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conditional** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Though microkinetic modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions.
   A. dependent on conditions
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because catalyst deactivation dominates all evidence
   C. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like microkinetic modeling are needed

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   B. temperature-programmed desorption
   C. poisoning by CO
   D. the price of coal in 1700

4. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents structure-sensitive activity from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control facet dependence
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once structure-sensitive activity is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. The passage implies that surface microscopy directly measures causes, meaning confounding from facet dependence is impossible.
   D. Because structure-sensitive activity appears, the mechanism must be unique, so facet dependence can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | surface microscopy | Depends on modeling priors |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It makes facet dependence irrelevant.
   B. It proves structure-sensitive activity is unique.
   C. May be muted by other processes
   D. It replaces DFT surface modeling with intuition.

6. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage suggests that structure-sensitive activity is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when adsorbate coverage effects can mimic structure-sensitive activity.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving microkinetic modeling.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away adsorbate coverage effects, since variability is merely a measurement error.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on DFT surface modeling simple.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selectivity shifts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates support interactions.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in electrochemical interfaces and everywhere else.

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The discussion suggests that catalyst deactivation is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The author argues that temperature-programmed desorption should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage implies that electrochemical interfaces is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where temperature-programmed desorption constrains catalyst deactivation

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
