Passage 0641: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 716)

When memory is tested repeatedly, researchers found that researchers have treated
devaluation of rejected alternatives as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization. Even if longitudinal attitude surveys can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Granted that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how measurement
reactivity can shift baselines, altering whether devaluation of rejected alternatives is
even comparable across cases, an outcome that means that a good fit is not the same as a
good explanation. Should measurement reactivity is changed while the nominal driver remains
constant be true, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In
this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

Using longitudinal attitude surveys under stable conditions, the argument reframes the issue
so that one frequently cited case from consumer choice studies appeared to support the
direct-readout view. [A] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows.
Although the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that
small shifts in measurement reactivity altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic
devaluation of rejected alternatives. [B] The author suggests that the same evidence can
support multiple stories when priors differ. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic;
this, in turn, illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization
is attempted. [C] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
[D] Later comparisons reveal why this matters.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—devaluation of rejected
alternatives—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat devaluation of rejected alternatives as an endpoint, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.
In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Not until analysts began combining longitudinal attitude surveys with cross-site comparisons
was it clear that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which devaluation of rejected alternatives could be explained
in more than one way because confounders like measurement reactivity often co-vary with the
driver, which is why replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors
became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable.

What matters most is the apparent regularity of devaluation of rejected alternatives, which
is why drives the first interpretation: devaluation of rejected alternatives is treated as a
direct readout of mechanism. If devaluation of rejected alternatives is uniquely produced by
one causal pathway is granted, then observations from consumer choice studies would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. the literature is full of such
claims, not because the caveat that measurement reactivity might reproduce the same pattern,
but because the assumptions differ. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. While it is true that
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which devaluation of rejected alternatives is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | meta-analytic synthesis | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | shifted confidence judgments | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | cultural norms about consistency | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Can mimic the target feature
   B. It proves selective memory for supporting evidence is unique.
   C. Can be contaminated by background variability
   D. Depends on modeling priors

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The author argues that implicit association tests should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains public versus private commitment
   C. The discussion suggests that public versus private commitment is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'post-choice attitude change' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **degenerate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence
   B. not uniquely determined
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like choice-induced preference paradigms are needed
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

4. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize model assumptions?
   A. it prevents increased liking for chosen options from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity
   B. Because measurement reactivity co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. Because increased liking for chosen options appears, the mechanism must be unique, so measurement reactivity can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once increased liking for chosen options is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

5. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

   C. implicit association tests
   D. selective memory for supporting evidence

7. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving implicit association tests.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using implicit association tests.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when self-concept threat can mimic shifted confidence judgments.
   D. The passage suggests that shifted confidence judgments is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. public versus private commitment alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. shifted confidence judgments specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. longitudinal attitude surveys as a device rather than as an analytic approach

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on meta-analytic synthesis simple.

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using implicit association tests are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats implicit association tests as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting implicit association tests as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining implicit association tests with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
