Passage 0871: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 748)

Despite tidy textbook narratives, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated shifts
in industrial labor demand as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. Admittedly, census microdata analysis can make the pattern look unusually
sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using census microdata analysis under stable conditions, the argument reframes the issue so
that one frequently cited case from Philadelphia appeared to support the direct-readout
view. Even if the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed
that small shifts in wartime industry demand altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic
shifts in industrial labor demand. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which
forces analysts to admit that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted. In this sense, african american internal migration is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from
description to explanation be true, then the same observation—shifts in industrial labor
demand—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas
popular summaries treat shifts in industrial labor demand as an endpoint invites a tidy
story, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on wartime industry demand, the
interpretation shifts, and many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban
transformation as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized shifts in
industrial labor demand as a signature in one account, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ in another. this shift mattered for
how evidence from Philadelphia was generalized because local conditions can change which
processes generate shifts in industrial labor demand. In this sense, south-to-north
population movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify wartime industry demand
occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which census microdata analysis constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. While it is true that a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

Rarely, unless analysts began combining census microdata analysis with cross-site
comparisons, does one see why claims about the great migration and northern urban
transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. [A] The author suggests that the same evidence can support multiple stories
when priors differ. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which
shifts in industrial labor demand could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like wartime industry demand often co-vary with the driver. [B] This detail
becomes important later, when assumptions are tested. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which changes whether
two analyses are actually comparable. [C] The passage highlights that mechanism claims must
survive out-of-sample checks. [D] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on
what the data cannot rule out. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about the great
migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted that the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which shifts in industrial labor demand is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This point matters because the simplest interpretation often survives only by silently restricting the range of cases under discussion.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like wartime industry demand make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting housing record reconstruction as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats housing record reconstruction as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifts in industrial labor demand or wartime industry demand. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that shifts in industrial labor demand is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how wartime industry demand can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Chicago. Finally, it maintains that tests combining housing record reconstruction with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   D. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that wartime industry demand is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using housing record reconstruction are unnecessary.

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates wartime industry demand.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on oral history synthesis simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Harlem and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies one mechanism.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | labor market inference from wage series | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | political realignment patterns | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | racial violence and intimidation | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Adds correlated noise
   B. It replaces census microdata analysis with intuition.
   C. Can vary across epochs
   D. It proves shifts in industrial labor demand is unique.

5. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize confounder control?
   A. Because push–pull dynamics co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents shifts in industrial labor demand from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control push–pull dynamics
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifts in industrial labor demand is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if labor market inference from wage series produces a tight fit on one dataset.

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The author argues that oral history synthesis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where oral history synthesis constrains housing covenants and policy constraints
   C. The passage implies that Philadelphia is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The passage treats political realignment patterns as a confounder and housing covenants and policy constraints as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **degenerate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify wartime industry demand occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
   A. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   B. not uniquely determined
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like labor market inference from wage series are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because housing covenants and policy constraints dominates all evidence

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. political realignment patterns specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. racial violence and intimidation alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. census microdata analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach

9. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when housing covenants and policy constraints can mimic political realignment patterns.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using oral history synthesis.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving oral history synthesis.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away housing covenants and policy constraints, since variability is merely a measurement error.

10. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the author’s favorite color
   B. census microdata analysis
   C. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
