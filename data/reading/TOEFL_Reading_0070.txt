Passage 0070: Urban Heat Islands and the Physics of Hot Nights in Built Landscapes (Environmental Science)
==========================================================================================================
(Word count: 606)

On a clear summer afternoon, a city can be several degrees warmer than the countryside
around it. This difference, known as the urban heat island effect, is not caused by a single
culprit but by a stack of physical changes that accompany urbanization. Where soils and
vegetation once absorbed rain and cooled the air through evapotranspiration, asphalt and
concrete now dominate. Where surfaces once reflected sunlight or converted it into latent
heat of evaporation, dark roofs and roads absorb it and store it as sensible heat.

Materials matter. Concrete, brick, and asphalt have thermal properties that allow them to
store energy during the day and release it slowly at night. The geometry of streets matters
as well. Tall buildings create “urban canyons” that trap longwave radiation and reduce the
view of the cold night sky, slowing cooling. Vehicles, air conditioners, and industrial
processes add anthropogenic heat directly, which can be locally significant in dense
districts. [A] As a result, the heat island often peaks not at noon, when solar input is
greatest, but after sunset, when rural areas cool rapidly and cities continue to leak stored
heat.

The consequences are not evenly distributed. Heat risk depends on exposure and on
vulnerability. Older adults, infants, and people with cardiovascular disease can be more
susceptible to heat stress. Neighborhoods with fewer trees and more pavement—often those
shaped by historical disinvestment—can experience higher temperatures, compounding social
inequities. Moreover, warm nights are particularly dangerous because they prevent
physiological recovery. A heatwave with modest daytime highs can still produce excess
mortality if nighttime temperatures remain elevated.

Mitigation strategies target the physics. “Cool roofs” use reflective coatings to increase
albedo, reducing daytime heat absorption. Permeable pavements and green infrastructure
increase infiltration and evapotranspiration, converting some energy into latent heat rather
than warming air. Urban trees provide shade and evaporative cooling, though their benefits
depend on species choice, canopy health, and water availability. Green roofs can insulate
buildings while also providing evaporative surfaces, yet they require structural support and
maintenance. [B] Each intervention changes an energy balance, but each also carries trade-
offs—maintenance costs, water demands, and, in some cases, allergenic pollen.

Measuring heat islands requires attention to scale. Satellites map land surface temperature,
which captures how hot roofs and roads become, yet surface temperature is not the same as
air temperature experienced by pedestrians. Networks of ground sensors, mobile measurements
on bikes, and weather-station data help estimate canopy-layer heat, which is more directly
relevant to health. Because wind, humidity, and cloud cover modify heat islands, a city’s
hottest neighborhood can shift across days and seasons. Effective planning therefore depends
on repeated measurements and on models that link urban form to thermal exposure.

The most robust approach combines design and governance. Building codes can encourage
reflective materials; transit policies can reduce waste heat from traffic; and tree-planting
programs can focus on neighborhoods with the highest vulnerability. Yet interventions should
be evaluated with local data, because a strategy that works in a humid climate may behave
differently in an arid one, where evaporative cooling interacts with water scarcity. [C]
Heat mitigation is therefore not a single project but a portfolio of actions matched to
local constraints.

Urban heat islands, then, are a reminder that climate is experienced in streets, not in
global averages. [D] By reshaping surfaces and air flows, cities create their own
microclimates—and by reshaping them again through thoughtful design, they can reduce heat
risks that would otherwise be built into the everyday environment.

At night, stored heat is released from walls and asphalt, which is why heat islands can be
most dangerous during warm, still evenings.


Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, why can the urban heat island effect be strongest after sunset?
   A. Cities release stored heat from materials while rural areas cool faster, widening the temperature gap
   B. Sunlight becomes stronger after sunset in cities
   C. Trees emit heat at night and make rural areas warmer than cities
   D. Air conditioners stop working at night, cooling cities instantly

2. [Vocabulary] The word “albedo” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. the fraction of sunlight a surface reflects
   B. the amount of oxygen stored in a catalyst
   C. the frequency of an EEG spindle
   D. a legal contract specifying pigment use

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why warm nights are especially dangerous during heatwaves?
   A. They limit physiological recovery because bodies cannot cool down adequately between days
   B. They cause urban trees to photosynthesize faster, raising temperatures
   C. They reduce satellite surface temperature readings, hiding the risk
   D. They eliminate the need for hydration because sweating decreases

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following mitigation strategies are mentioned EXCEPT:
   A. reflective cool roofs
   B. green roofs and urban trees
   C. permeable pavements that increase infiltration
   D. adding lead compounds to gasoline to reduce heat

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author distinguish surface temperature from air temperature when discussing measurement?
   A. To show that different measurement methods capture different aspects of heat exposure relevant to human health
   B. To argue that satellites are useless for any urban research
   C. To claim that air temperature is unaffected by urban design
   D. To suggest that ground sensors should replace all weather stations

7. [Reference] In the passage, “each intervention” refers to:
   A. strategies such as cool roofs, trees, permeable pavements, and green roofs that alter the urban energy balance
   B. the thalamus generating spindles
   C. urchins grazing kelp in barrens
   D. luminescence dating of quartz grains

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains physical causes of heat islands, describes unequal impacts, surveys mitigation options and their trade-offs, discusses measurement challenges, then argues for combined design and policy approaches
   B. It provides a list of the world’s hottest cities without explanation
   C. It argues that heat islands are caused only by air conditioners
   D. It focuses exclusively on pollen allergies and ignores temperature

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that planning depends on repeated measurements?
   A. Because wind and weather change, identifying persistent hot spots and evaluating interventions requires data collected across times and conditions
   B. One satellite image is enough to determine long-term heat risk everywhere
   C. Heat islands do not vary across days, so models are unnecessary
   D. Repeated measurements worsen heat islands by adding sensor heat

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Urban heat islands are unavoidable because city materials cannot be changed.
   B. The passage explains urban heat islands as temperature increases driven by heat-absorbing surfaces, urban geometry, and waste heat, notes that risks are uneven and nights can be especially harmful, and describes mitigation and measurement approaches—cool roofs, green infrastructure, and targeted programs—emphasizing trade-offs and the need for local data and coordinated action.
   C. Heat islands occur only in winter because buildings block sunlight.
   D. Satellites measure air temperature directly, so ground sensors are unnecessary.
