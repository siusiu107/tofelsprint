Passage 0070: Urban Heat Islands and the Physics of Hot Nights in Built Landscapes (Environmental Science)
==========================================================================================================
(Word count: 606)

On a clear summer afternoon, a city can be several degrees warmer than the countryside
around it. This difference, known as the urban heat island effect, is not caused by a single
culprit but by a stack of physical changes that accompany urbanization. Where soils and
vegetation once absorbed rain and cooled the air through evapotranspiration, asphalt and
concrete now dominate. Where surfaces once reflected sunlight or converted it into latent
heat of evaporation, dark roofs and roads absorb it and store it as sensible heat.

Materials matter. Concrete, brick, and asphalt have thermal properties that allow them to
store energy during the day and release it slowly at night. The geometry of streets matters
as well. Tall buildings create “urban canyons” that trap longwave radiation and reduce the
view of the cold night sky, slowing cooling. Vehicles, air conditioners, and industrial
processes add anthropogenic heat directly, which can be locally significant in dense
districts. [A] As a result, the heat island often peaks not at noon, when solar input is
greatest, but after sunset, when rural areas cool rapidly and cities continue to leak stored
heat.

The consequences are not evenly distributed. Heat risk depends on exposure and on
vulnerability. Older adults, infants, and people with cardiovascular disease can be more
susceptible to heat stress. Neighborhoods with fewer trees and more pavement—often those
shaped by historical disinvestment—can experience higher temperatures, compounding social
inequities. Moreover, warm nights are particularly dangerous because they prevent
physiological recovery. A heatwave with modest daytime highs can still produce excess
mortality if nighttime temperatures remain elevated.

Mitigation strategies target the physics. “Cool roofs” use reflective coatings to increase
albedo, reducing daytime heat absorption. Permeable pavements and green infrastructure
increase infiltration and evapotranspiration, converting some energy into latent heat rather
than warming air. Urban trees provide shade and evaporative cooling, though their benefits
depend on species choice, canopy health, and water availability. Green roofs can insulate
buildings while also providing evaporative surfaces, yet they require structural support and
maintenance. [B] Each intervention changes an energy balance, but each also carries trade-
offs—maintenance costs, water demands, and, in some cases, allergenic pollen.

Measuring heat islands requires attention to scale. Satellites map land surface temperature,
which captures how hot roofs and roads become, yet surface temperature is not the same as
air temperature experienced by pedestrians. Networks of ground sensors, mobile measurements
on bikes, and weather-station data help estimate canopy-layer heat, which is more directly
relevant to health. Because wind, humidity, and cloud cover modify heat islands, a city’s
hottest neighborhood can shift across days and seasons. Effective planning therefore depends
on repeated measurements and on models that link urban form to thermal exposure.

The most robust approach combines design and governance. Building codes can encourage
reflective materials; transit policies can reduce waste heat from traffic; and tree-planting
programs can focus on neighborhoods with the highest vulnerability. Yet interventions should
be evaluated with local data, because a strategy that works in a humid climate may behave
differently in an arid one, where evaporative cooling interacts with water scarcity. [C]
Heat mitigation is therefore not a single project but a portfolio of actions matched to
local constraints.

Urban heat islands, then, are a reminder that climate is experienced in streets, not in
global averages. [D] By reshaping surfaces and air flows, cities create their own
microclimates—and by reshaping them again through thoughtful design, they can reduce heat
risks that would otherwise be built into the everyday environment.

At night, stored heat is released from walls and asphalt, which is why heat islands can be
most dangerous during warm, still evenings.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The most robust approach combines design and governance.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to roofs and islands
   B. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of asphalt
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across asphalt

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that roofs is often incomplete and concludes that urban cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since asphalt overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of islands with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage surveys urban but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed islands first, with roofs serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats asphalt as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   C. The passage presents islands as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once roofs is observed, competing explanations for urban collapse. It treats asphalt as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, as the discussion implies.
   D. The passage explains urban by linking roofs to islands, and it shows why asphalt changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage treats roofs primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over islands are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about urban are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in asphalt, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of roofs is enough to validate islands for urban.
   C. The passage implies that asphalt mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes roofs effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of islands no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain urban, especially regarding energy, especially regarding roofs, especially regarding asphalt.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how urban should change if asphalt is altered, instead of assuming that roofs has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to islands must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of urban as a factor influencing roofs, especially regarding surfaces.
   B. discussion of islands as a factor influencing roofs
   C. discussion of asphalt as a factor influencing roofs
   D. discussion of stress corrosion cracking as a factor influencing roofs

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] By reshaping surfaces and air flows, cities create their own microclimates—and by reshaping them again through thoughtful design, they can reduce heat risks that would otherwise be built into the everyday environment.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   C. [D] By reshaping surfaces and air flows. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. [D] By reshaping surfaces and air flows. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once roofs fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and asphalt can be ignored without changing conclusions about urban.
   B. Because the presence of islands guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in asphalt are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because comparability prevents islands from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold asphalt constant while examining roofs.
   D. Because roofs directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding urban.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | roofs | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | asphalt | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It proves islands is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that urban should be read alongside asphalt, because roofs alone does not settle what islands means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This difference, known as the urban heat island effect, is not caused by a single culprit but by a stack of physical changes that accompany urbanization.
   A. the preceding claim about how roofs is interpreted in relation to islands
   B. the preceding claim that urban functions as a direct measurement of islands
   C. the preceding claim that asphalt alone explains the outcome of urban
   D. the preceding claim that roofs is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses islands, so debate over roofs is unnecessary noise, in the setting discussed.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of roofs lead to different conclusions about urban.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of roofs and islands should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to show that the term urban belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, as the argument develops.
