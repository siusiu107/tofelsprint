Passage 0780: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 729)

Despite apparently clean spectra, the passage argues that researchers have treated spurious
molecular detections as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
Granted that multi-epoch transit campaigns can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using multi-epoch transit campaigns under stable conditions, the passage suggests one
frequently cited case from bright nearby planet hosts appeared to support the direct-readout
view. Even though the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis
showed that small shifts in facula coverage fractions altered the baseline enough to mute or
mimic spurious molecular detections. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, a move
that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. In this sense, unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facula coverage fractions was
it clear that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which multi-epoch transit campaigns constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The argument hinges on what
would change under an alternative explanation. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation holds, then the same observation—spurious molecular detections—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The passage highlights
that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. Whereas popular summaries treat
spurious molecular detections as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive
under replication. [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is
narrowed. [D] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. In this
sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on facula coverage fractions, the argument
reframes the issue so that many early studies framed stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized spurious
molecular detections as a signature invites a tidy story, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ forces boundary conditions to be
stated. this shift mattered for how evidence from bright nearby planet hosts was generalized
because local conditions can change which processes generate spurious molecular detections,
which is why replication matters.

Only after analysts began combining multi-epoch transit campaigns with cross-site
comparisons did claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying
on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which spurious molecular detections could be explained in more than one way
largely because confounders like facula coverage fractions often co-vary with the driver. as
the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable. In this sense, photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Though the temptation
to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which
spurious molecular detections is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather
than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where chromatic transit analysis constrains facula coverage fractions
   B. The passage implies that M-dwarf systems with repeated transits is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author argues that chromatic transit analysis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'activity-driven spectral distortion' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.

2. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving simultaneous photometric monitoring.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when instrument drift across visits can mimic spurious molecular detections.
   C. The passage suggests that spurious molecular detections is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author treats M-dwarf systems with repeated transits as a special case and argues that no broader inference about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy is possible.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering
   B. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy
   C. simultaneous photometric monitoring
   D. a recipe for bread fermentation

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **coherent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which spurious molecular detections is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.
   A. well organized
   B. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like spot–facular forward modeling are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because instrument drift across visits dominates all evidence

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on chromatic transit analysis simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates limb-darkening model mismatch.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in multi-epoch JWST targets and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies one mechanism.

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that time-variable spectral baselines is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how facula coverage fractions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from multi-epoch JWST targets. Finally, it maintains that tests combining simultaneous photometric monitoring with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats simultaneous photometric monitoring as a historical curiosity and does not discuss time-variable spectral baselines or facula coverage fractions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like facula coverage fractions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting simultaneous photometric monitoring as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that facula coverage fractions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using simultaneous photometric monitoring are unnecessary.

7. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. simultaneous photometric monitoring as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. facula coverage fractions alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. spurious molecular detections specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

8. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. Since apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering is observed in active K-dwarf host stars, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. it prevents apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control facula coverage fractions
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if multi-epoch transit campaigns produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. Because facula coverage fractions co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
