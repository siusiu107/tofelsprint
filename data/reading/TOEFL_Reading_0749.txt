Passage 0749: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 746)

In hazard assessments, one sees why researchers have treated tsunami-generating seafloor
uplift as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip. Even if
continuous GPS geodesy can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that
such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting
debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces
analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives.

Using continuous GPS geodesy under stable conditions, the interpretation shifts, and one
frequently cited case from the Cascadia subduction zone appeared to support the direct-
readout view. Despite the fact that the original fit looked visually decisive, later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in stress transfer after large events altered
the baseline enough to mute or mimic tsunami-generating seafloor uplift. the passage treats
this episode as diagnostic, which is precisely why illustrates why boundary conditions must
be specified before generalization is attempted. In this sense, megathrust rupture dynamics
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is the apparent regularity of tsunami-generating seafloor uplift, rather than a single
headline feature, that drives the first interpretation: tsunami-generating seafloor uplift
is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. [A] This is presented not as a loophole, but as
a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Provided that tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is
uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then observations from the Cascadia subduction zone
would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. [B] The author treats
this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. the literature is full of such claims—not the
caveat that stress transfer after large events might reproduce the same pattern. [C] The
passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment.
[D] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence.

Admittedly, the first model can fit one dataset extremely well; nevertheless, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
stress transfer after large events can shift baselines, altering whether tsunami-generating
seafloor uplift is even comparable across cases, something that means that a good fit is not
the same as a good explanation. Unless stress transfer after large events is changed while
the nominal driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions
are perturbed cannot be claimed with confidence. In this sense, episodic tremor and slip is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—tsunami-generating seafloor uplift—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as an endpoint in one account, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in
another.

Only after analysts began combining continuous GPS geodesy with cross-site comparisons did
the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about subduction-zone megathrust
earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which tsunami-generating
seafloor uplift could be explained in more than one way because confounders like stress
transfer after large events often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes
whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, slow-slip events on plate
interfaces is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the
result is a framework in which tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like stress transfer after large events make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting seafloor pressure sensors as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats seafloor pressure sensors as a historical curiosity and does not discuss low-frequency tremor bursts or stress transfer after large events. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that low-frequency tremor bursts is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how stress transfer after large events can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Japan Trench region. Finally, it maintains that tests combining seafloor pressure sensors with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   D. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that stress transfer after large events is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using seafloor pressure sensors are unnecessary.

2. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that numerical rupture simulations directly measures causes, meaning confounding from locked versus creeping patches is impossible.
   B. Since transient surface deformation is observed in the Cascadia subduction zone, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. Because transient surface deformation appears, the mechanism must be unique, so locked versus creeping patches can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. it prevents transient surface deformation from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control locked versus creeping patches

3. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | numerical rupture simulations | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | foreshock clustering | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | stress transfer after large events | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Requires careful calibration
   B. It makes locked versus creeping patches irrelevant.
   C. Adds correlated noise
   D. It proves foreshock clustering is unique.

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The passage treats low-frequency tremor bursts as a confounder and fluid overpressure in faults as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where numerical rupture simulations constrains fluid overpressure in faults
   C. The author argues that numerical rupture simulations should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The passage implies that the Chilean margin is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving inversion of seismic waveforms.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when locked versus creeping patches can mimic foreshock clustering.
   C. The passage suggests that foreshock clustering is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away locked versus creeping patches, since variability is merely a measurement error.

6. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
