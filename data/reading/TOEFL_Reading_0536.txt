Passage 0536: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 702)

In surface-science experiments, researchers found that researchers have treated selectivity
shifts as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Admittedly,
surface microscopy can make the pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage
argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, a
move that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Using surface microscopy under stable conditions, it is difficult to deny that one
frequently cited case from laboratory single-crystal studies appeared to support the direct-
readout view. [A] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as
conditional. To be sure, the original fit looked visually decisive, yet later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in support interactions altered the baseline enough to
mute or mimic selectivity shifts. [B] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices
can masquerade as mechanism. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which is
precisely why illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. [C] The author suggests that the same evidence can support multiple stories when
priors differ. [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on support interactions, it is difficult to
deny that many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces as a
single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized selectivity shifts as a
signature, later work asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines
differ. this shift mattered for how evidence from laboratory single-crystal studies was
generalized largely because local conditions can change which processes generate selectivity
shifts.

Only through analysts began combining surface microscopy with cross-site comparisons could
one reasonably claim that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which selectivity shifts could be explained in more than one way
because, as the author notes, confounders like support interactions often co-vary with the
driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than
a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In
this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—selectivity shifts—must be paired with tests
that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
selectivity shifts as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify support interactions did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which surface microscopy constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome
that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any
story is arbitrary. Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is
strong, the result is a framework in which selectivity shifts is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The passage implies that industrial hydrogenation reactors is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The discussion suggests that catalyst deactivation is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The author argues that surface microscopy should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where surface microscopy constrains catalyst deactivation

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | DFT surface modeling | May not generalize across contexts |

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selectivity shifts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in laboratory single-crystal studies and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on surface microscopy simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates adsorbate coverage effects.

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. temperature-programmed desorption as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. poisoning by CO specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. support interactions alone, treated as the sole cause

5. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. Because support interactions co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents selectivity shifts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control support interactions
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once selectivity shifts is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if in situ spectroscopy produces a tight fit on one dataset.

6. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **sparse** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Working with sparse records and limited controls on support interactions, it is difficult to deny that many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces as a single-mechanism phenomenon.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like microkinetic modeling are needed
   B. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   C. thinly spread
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because support interactions dominates all evidence

7. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using in situ spectroscopy.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when support interactions can mimic poisoning by CO.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving in situ spectroscopy.
   D. The passage suggests that poisoning by CO is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

   C. [C]
   D. [D]

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats temperature-programmed desorption as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rate enhancement or adsorbate coverage effects. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that rate enhancement is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how adsorbate coverage effects can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from automotive catalytic converters. Finally, it maintains that tests combining temperature-programmed desorption with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   C. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like adsorbate coverage effects make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting temperature-programmed desorption as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because rate enhancement uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that adsorbate coverage effects is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using temperature-programmed desorption are unnecessary.
