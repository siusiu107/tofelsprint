Passage 0770: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 739)

In the last decade, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: researchers have
treated time-variable spectral baselines as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in
transit spectroscopy. To be sure, Gaussian-process detrending can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, yet the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike bright nearby
planet hosts. [A] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows. the
same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because
instrument drift across visits shifted the baseline in different directions across sites.
[B] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. the author
therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating time-variable
spectral baselines as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ. [C]
The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. [D] The author notes that
generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. In this sense, unocculted
spot/facula bias in transit data is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

It is the apparent regularity of time-variable spectral baselines, rather than a single
headline feature, that drives the first interpretation: time-variable spectral baselines is
treated as a direct readout of mechanism. Should time-variable spectral baselines is
uniquely produced by one causal pathway be true, then observations from bright nearby planet
hosts would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. The issue is not
the caveat that instrument drift across visits might reproduce the same pattern; it is that
the literature is full of such claims.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—time-variable spectral baselines—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat time-variable spectral baselines as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. In this sense, activity-
driven spectral distortion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify instrument
drift across visits. by comparing cases in which Gaussian-process detrending constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. To be sure, a
single case can be dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move
from description to explanation, then the same observation—time-variable spectral
baselines—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat time-variable spectral baselines as an endpoint invites a
tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. In this sense, photospheric
contamination of transmission spectra is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome
that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any
story is arbitrary. Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is
strong, the result is a framework in which time-variable spectral baselines is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that rotation-modulated light curves is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away instrument drift across visits, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using chromatic transit analysis.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when instrument drift across visits can mimic rotation-modulated light curves.

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In other words, the disagreement is not about whether the data exist, but about what the data are evidence for.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize confounder control?
   A. Because starspot temperature contrasts co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. The passage implies that multi-epoch transit campaigns directly measures causes, meaning confounding from starspot temperature contrasts is impossible.
   C. it prevents spurious molecular detections from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control starspot temperature contrasts
   D. Since spurious molecular detections is observed in M-dwarf systems with repeated transits, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the passage juxtapose two accounts of the phenomenon?
   A. The discussion suggests that instrument drift across visits is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The passage implies that M-dwarf systems with repeated transits is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where chromatic transit analysis constrains instrument drift across visits

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in multi-epoch JWST targets and everywhere else.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates starspot temperature contrasts.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on multi-epoch transit campaigns simple.

   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It makes facula coverage fractions irrelevant.
   B. Can be contaminated by background variability
   C. May not generalize across contexts

7. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. instrument drift across visits alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. spot–facular forward modeling as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. time-variable spectral baselines specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats simultaneous photometric monitoring as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rotation-modulated light curves or instrument drift across visits. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that rotation-modulated light curves is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how instrument drift across visits can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from M-dwarf systems with repeated transits. Finally, it maintains that tests combining simultaneous photometric monitoring with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   C. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because rotation-modulated light curves uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that instrument drift across visits is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using simultaneous photometric monitoring are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like instrument drift across visits make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting simultaneous photometric monitoring as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

9. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **preliminary** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Whereas popular summaries treat time-variable spectral baselines as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.
   A. early
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because facula coverage fractions dominates all evidence
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like Gaussian-process detrending are needed
   D. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail
