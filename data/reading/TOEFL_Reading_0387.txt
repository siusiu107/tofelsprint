Passage 0387: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 766)

In cross-site comparisons, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated reduced
photosynthetic efficiency as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves. Although degree-heating-week metrics can make the pattern look unusually sharp,
the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives. Not until analysts began combining degree-heating-
week metrics with cross-site comparisons did claims about coral bleaching triggered by
marine heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which reduced photosynthetic efficiency
could be explained in more than one way because confounders like symbiont clade switching
often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
something that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, thermal
bleaching events is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Not
the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—reduced photosynthetic efficiency—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat reduced photosynthetic efficiency as an endpoint may be convenient, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is
scientifically revealing. Using degree-heating-week metrics under stable conditions, the
interpretation shifts, and one frequently cited case from the Coral Triangle appeared to
support the direct-readout view. Despite the fact that the original fit looked visually
decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in symbiont clade switching
altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic reduced photosynthetic efficiency. the passage
treats this episode as diagnostic, an outcome that illustrates why boundary conditions must
be specified before generalization is attempted. Working with sparse records and limited
controls on symbiont clade switching, many early studies framed coral bleaching triggered by
marine heatwaves as a single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] This becomes a pivot point where the
earlier interpretation is narrowed. Whereas those studies emphasized reduced photosynthetic
efficiency as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under replication. [B]
The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating them as afterthoughts. this
shift mattered for how evidence from the Coral Triangle was generalized because, as the
author notes, local conditions can change which processes generate reduced photosynthetic
efficiency. [C] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as
an embarrassment. [D] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the
pipeline. In this sense, loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Using degree-heating-week metrics
under stable conditions, the author treats the complication as diagnostic, so one frequently
cited case from the Coral Triangle appeared to support the direct-readout view. Even if the
original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts
in symbiont clade switching altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic reduced
photosynthetic efficiency. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, a move that
illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted.
Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify symbiont clade switching
occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which degree-heating-week metrics constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, one sees why the
passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces
competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about coral bleaching
triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a
tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories
without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. shading and cooling refugia alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. recruitment failure specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. satellite thermal stress maps as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | symbiont genotyping | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | recruitment failure | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | shading and cooling refugia | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Samples only part of the system
   B. Can be contaminated by background variability
   C. It replaces degree-heating-week metrics with intuition.
   D. Co-varies with the driver of interest

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where symbiont genotyping constrains disease outbreaks
   B. The discussion suggests that disease outbreaks is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The author argues that symbiont genotyping should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'thermal bleaching events' refers to a different field altogether, not to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the price of coal in 1700
   B. mortality and phase shifts
   C. photophysiology measurements
   D. Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away compound stressors such as acidification and pollution, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when compound stressors such as acidification and pollution can mimic mortality and phase shifts.
   C. The passage suggests that mortality and phase shifts is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author treats the Coral Triangle as a special case and argues that no broader inference about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves is possible.

6. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: That shift in framing changed which questions were even worth asking, since 'detection' and 'interpretation' were no longer treated as the same task.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

7. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that symbiont genotyping directly measures causes, meaning confounding from disease outbreaks is impossible.
   B. it prevents reduced photosynthetic efficiency from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control disease outbreaks
   C. Since reduced photosynthetic efficiency is observed in the Great Barrier Reef, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because disease outbreaks co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because changes in reef fish assemblages uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that symbiont clade switching is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using reef-scale temperature loggers are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like symbiont clade switching make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting reef-scale temperature loggers as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that changes in reef fish assemblages is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how symbiont clade switching can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Caribbean reef tracts. Finally, it maintains that tests combining reef-scale temperature loggers with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats reef-scale temperature loggers as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in reef fish assemblages or symbiont clade switching. It ends without any methodological implication.

9. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **persistent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. lasting
   B. irrelevant to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like degree-heating-week metrics are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because local adaptation dominates all evidence

10. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates disease outbreaks.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on symbiont genotyping simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Red Sea reefs and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because mortality and phase shifts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
