Passage 0285: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 700)

When catalysts are benchmarked across labs, researchers have treated poisoning by CO as the
decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Admittedly, DFT surface
modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that
such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting
debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which is
precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation,
a different prediction follows: then the same observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries
treat poisoning by CO as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting
point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. In this sense,
surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify support interactions did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which DFT surface modeling constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative.

Not until analysts began combining DFT surface modeling with cross-site comparisons did
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped relying on a single figure
and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which
poisoning by CO could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like
support interactions often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts to
admit that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, platinum-
catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike automotive catalytic converters. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because support
interactions shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. So the author
therefore separates detection from interpretation, and so, too, does the evidence undermine
treating poisoning by CO as a self-sufficient conclusion.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify support interactions did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] This point forces
the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline. by comparing cases in which DFT
surface modeling constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive
out of sample, which helps explain why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. [B] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as
evidence. a single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] Later comparisons
reveal why this matters. [D] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a
decisive test. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record
can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted that the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which poisoning by CO is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The passage implies that industrial hydrogenation reactors is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author argues that DFT surface modeling should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where DFT surface modeling constrains catalyst deactivation
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'surface-mediated catalysis on Pt' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | microkinetic modeling | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | selectivity shifts | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | facet dependence | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It proves selectivity shifts is unique.
   B. It makes support interactions irrelevant.
   C. Can introduce systematic bias
   D. Can vary across epochs

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **coherent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify support interactions did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because catalyst deactivation dominates all evidence
   B. well organized
   C. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like DFT surface modeling are needed

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: That shift in framing changed which questions were even worth asking, since 'detection' and 'interpretation' were no longer treated as the same task.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like support interactions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting in situ spectroscopy as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because structure-sensitive activity uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that support interactions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using in situ spectroscopy are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats in situ spectroscopy as a historical curiosity and does not discuss structure-sensitive activity or support interactions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that structure-sensitive activity is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how support interactions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from industrial hydrogenation reactors. Finally, it maintains that tests combining in situ spectroscopy with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.

6. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facet dependence can mimic selectivity shifts.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away facet dependence, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The passage suggests that selectivity shifts is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author treats automotive catalytic converters as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because poisoning by CO uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates facet dependence.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in automotive catalytic converters and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on temperature-programmed desorption simple.

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. in situ spectroscopy as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. adsorbate coverage effects alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. selectivity shifts specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. structure-sensitive activity
   B. a recipe for bread fermentation
   C. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   D. DFT surface modeling

10. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once poisoning by CO is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Because poisoning by CO appears, the mechanism must be unique, so catalyst deactivation can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if surface microscopy produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. it prevents poisoning by CO from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control catalyst deactivation
