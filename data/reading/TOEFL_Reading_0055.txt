Passage 0055: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 780)

Under multi-epoch monitoring, researchers have treated rotation-modulated light curves as
the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy. multi-epoch transit
campaigns can make the pattern look unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Rarely,
unless analysts began combining multi-epoch transit campaigns with cross-site comparisons,
does one see why claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying
on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. [A] That point is not
rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows. the goal was to break degeneracies in
which rotation-modulated light curves could be explained in more than one way because, as
the author notes, confounders like facula coverage fractions often co-vary with the driver.
[B] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as an
embarrassment. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. [C] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead to a
different conclusion. [D] The author implies that replication is informative only when
protocols are comparable. In this sense, unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Rarely has it been the case
that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical, at least before
the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facula coverage fractions. by comparing
cases in which multi-epoch transit campaigns constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, a move that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike bright nearby planet hosts. The passage
argues that the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms
differed because facula coverage fractions shifted the baseline in different directions
across sites. So the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, and so, too,
does the evidence undermine treating rotation-modulated light curves as a self-sufficient
conclusion. Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facula coverage
fractions did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which multi-epoch transit campaigns constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even if a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. If anything is responsible,
it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage presents as the lesson of stellar
contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what competing models
would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the
same observation—rotation-modulated light curves—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat rotation-modulated light
curves as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts in another. Hardly had analysts began combining
multi-epoch transit campaigns with cross-site comparisons occurred when claims about stellar
contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying on a single figure and started relying
on falsifiable predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in
which rotation-modulated light curves could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like facula coverage fractions often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
which changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, photospheric
contamination of transmission spectra is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label. In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most
informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.
by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional
on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to
admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy
   B. rotation-modulated light curves
   C. a recipe for bread fermentation
   D. chromatic transit analysis

2. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. Because instrument drift across visits co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control instrument drift across visits
   C. Because apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering appears, the mechanism must be unique, so instrument drift across visits can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. Since apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering is observed in M-dwarf systems with repeated transits, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The discussion suggests that limb-darkening model mismatch is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where chromatic transit analysis constrains limb-darkening model mismatch
   C. The passage implies that bright nearby planet hosts is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'photospheric contamination of transmission spectra' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.

5. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when instrument drift across visits can mimic apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using spot–facular forward modeling.
   C. The author treats M-dwarf systems with repeated transits as a special case and argues that no broader inference about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy is possible.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away instrument drift across visits, since variability is merely a measurement error.

   Sentence: Under multi-epoch monitoring, researchers have treated rotation-modulated light curves as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because limb-darkening model mismatch dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like Gaussian-process detrending are needed
   D. slight

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because rotation-modulated light curves uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates starspot temperature contrasts.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in active K-dwarf host stars and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on Gaussian-process detrending simple.

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that limb-darkening model mismatch is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using Gaussian-process detrending are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats Gaussian-process detrending as a historical curiosity and does not discuss time-variable spectral baselines or limb-darkening model mismatch. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like limb-darkening model mismatch make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting Gaussian-process detrending as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that time-variable spectral baselines is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how limb-darkening model mismatch can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from active K-dwarf host stars. Finally, it maintains that tests combining Gaussian-process detrending with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
