Passage 0961: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 725)

In tectonically active margins, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated low-
frequency tremor bursts as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and
slow slip. Even though seafloor pressure sensors can make the pattern look unusually sharp,
the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Only by analysts began combining seafloor pressure sensors with cross-site comparisons was
the field forced to accept that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow
slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the
goal was to break degeneracies in which low-frequency tremor bursts could be explained in
more than one way because confounders like locked versus creeping patches often co-vary with
the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

It is the apparent regularity of low-frequency tremor bursts that drives the first
interpretation: low-frequency tremor bursts is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. If
low-frequency tremor bursts is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, a different
prediction follows: then observations from Sumatra–Andaman would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. the literature is full of such claims—not the
caveat that locked versus creeping patches might reproduce the same pattern.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from
description to explanation to fail, then the same observation—low-frequency tremor
bursts—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas
popular summaries treat low-frequency tremor bursts as an endpoint, the passage treats it as
a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. In this sense,
episodic tremor and slip is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Though the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. [A] The author shifts from
narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. it highlights how locked
versus creeping patches can shift baselines, altering whether low-frequency tremor bursts is
even comparable across cases, which means that a good fit is not the same as a good
explanation. [B] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested. If locked
versus creeping patches is changed while the nominal driver remains constant, one should
expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. [C] The passage returns to this
point to clarify what counts as evidence. [D] The author suggests that the same evidence can
support multiple stories when priors differ.

Using seafloor pressure sensors under stable conditions, the author treats the complication
as diagnostic, so one frequently cited case from Sumatra–Andaman appeared to support the
direct-readout view. While it is true that the original fit looked visually decisive, later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in locked versus creeping patches altered the
baseline enough to mute or mimic low-frequency tremor bursts. the passage treats this
episode as diagnostic, which is precisely why illustrates why boundary conditions must be
specified before generalization is attempted. In this sense, slow-slip events on plate
interfaces is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. While
it is true that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the
result is a framework in which low-frequency tremor bursts is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

   D. complete and final, so no further checks like paleoseismic trenching are needed

4. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. Because foreshock clustering appears, the mechanism must be unique, so locked versus creeping patches can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. The passage implies that inversion of seismic waveforms directly measures causes, meaning confounding from locked versus creeping patches is impossible.
   C. Since foreshock clustering is observed in the Japan Trench region, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. it prevents foreshock clustering from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control locked versus creeping patches

5. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. inversion of seismic waveforms
   B. the author’s favorite color
   C. Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip
   D. foreshock clustering

6. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away fluid overpressure in faults, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using numerical rupture simulations.
   C. The author treats the Japan Trench region as a special case and argues that no broader inference about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip is possible.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when fluid overpressure in faults can mimic low-frequency tremor bursts.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | seafloor pressure sensors | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | low-frequency tremor bursts | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |

   A. May not generalize across contexts
   B. It proves tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is unique.
   C. Can mimic the target feature
   D. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because foreshock clustering uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that heterogeneous frictional properties is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using inversion of seismic waveforms are unnecessary.
   B. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that foreshock clustering is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how heterogeneous frictional properties can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Cascadia subduction zone. Finally, it maintains that tests combining inversion of seismic waveforms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   C. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like heterogeneous frictional properties make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting inversion of seismic waveforms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats inversion of seismic waveforms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss foreshock clustering or heterogeneous frictional properties. It ends without any methodological implication.

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where seafloor pressure sensors constrains fluid overpressure in faults
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'strain accumulation and release in subduction zones' refers to a different field altogether, not to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip.
   C. The passage implies that the Chilean margin is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The author argues that seafloor pressure sensors should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

10. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Sumatra–Andaman and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates heterogeneous frictional properties.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on numerical rupture simulations simple.
