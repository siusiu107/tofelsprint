Passage 0875: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 723)

Despite seemingly clear effect sizes, one sees why researchers have treated devaluation of
rejected alternatives as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. choice-induced preference paradigms can make the pattern look unusually
sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike workplace decision settings. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because measurement
reactivity shifted the baseline in different directions across sites, which is why
replication matters. The issue is not treating devaluation of rejected alternatives as a
self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] Later comparisons reveal why
this matters. Were one wishes to move from description to explanation to fail, then the same
observation—devaluation of rejected alternatives—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. [B] The author uses the example to separate detection
from interpretation. Whereas popular summaries treat devaluation of rejected alternatives as
an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. [C] The
argument hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation. [D] The author notes
that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case.

What matters most is the apparent regularity of devaluation of rejected alternatives, which
is why drives the first interpretation: devaluation of rejected alternatives is treated as a
direct readout of mechanism. If devaluation of rejected alternatives is uniquely produced by
one causal pathway is granted, then observations from workplace decision settings would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. the literature is full of such
claims, not because the caveat that measurement reactivity might reproduce the same pattern,
but because the assumptions differ. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement
reactivity. by comparing cases in which choice-induced preference paradigms constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn,
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Granted that a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—devaluation of
rejected alternatives—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat devaluation of rejected alternatives as an
endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. While
it is true that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the
result is a framework in which devaluation of rejected alternatives is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on implicit association tests simple.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-national survey samples and everywhere else.

3. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using implicit association tests.
   B. The author treats consumer choice studies as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic shifted confidence judgments.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving implicit association tests.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | implicit association tests | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | increased liking for chosen options | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | public versus private commitment | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Adds correlated noise
   B. Can be degenerate with another effect
   C. It replaces implicit association tests with intuition.
   D. It makes self-concept threat irrelevant.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **degenerate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: If one wishes to move from description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—devaluation of rejected alternatives—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because self-concept threat dominates all evidence
   B. not uniquely determined
   C. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like behavioral priming designs are needed

6. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. meta-analytic synthesis
   B. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   C. a list of Olympic medal counts
   D. devaluation of rejected alternatives

7. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains public versus private commitment
   B. The author argues that implicit association tests should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage implies that consumer choice studies is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'self-justification mechanisms' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.

8. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity
   B. Because measurement reactivity co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. Since selective memory for supporting evidence is observed in political opinion panels, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if behavioral priming designs produces a tight fit on one dataset.

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: The issue is not treating devaluation of rejected alternatives as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation.
   A. cultural norms about consistency alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. meta-analytic synthesis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats behavioral priming designs as a historical curiosity and does not discuss devaluation of rejected alternatives or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting behavioral priming designs as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using behavioral priming designs are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that devaluation of rejected alternatives is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-national survey samples. Finally, it maintains that tests combining behavioral priming designs with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
