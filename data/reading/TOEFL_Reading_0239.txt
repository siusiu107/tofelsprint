Passage 0239: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 738)

In comparative migration studies, one sees why researchers have treated changes in
neighborhood composition as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. Granted that housing record reconstruction can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. [A] The passage frames uncertainty as an
ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same
observation—changes in neighborhood composition—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. [B] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which
prediction follows. Whereas popular summaries treat changes in neighborhood composition as
an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts. [C] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating
them as afterthoughts. [D] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. In this sense, african
american internal migration is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—changes in
neighborhood composition—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat changes in neighborhood composition as an endpoint
looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication.

Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify push–pull dynamics was the field
forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which housing record reconstruction constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps
explain why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Granted that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, south-to-north
population movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify push–pull dynamics, did
investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which housing record reconstruction constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why
the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Despite the fact that a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative.

Not the obvious explanation but the apparent regularity of changes in neighborhood
composition is what drives the first interpretation: changes in neighborhood composition is
treated as a direct readout of mechanism. If changes in neighborhood composition is uniquely
produced by one causal pathway, then observations from Chicago would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. Not the caveat that push–pull dynamics might
reproduce the same pattern, but the literature is full of such claims. In this sense,
twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to
admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary. Granted that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive
answer is strong, the result is a framework in which changes in neighborhood composition is
interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that changes in neighborhood composition is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how housing covenants and policy constraints can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Chicago. Finally, it maintains that tests combining labor market inference from wage series with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats labor market inference from wage series as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in neighborhood composition or housing covenants and policy constraints. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like housing covenants and policy constraints make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting labor market inference from wage series as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that housing covenants and policy constraints is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using labor market inference from wage series are unnecessary.

2. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: If one wishes to move from description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—changes in neighborhood composition—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. shifts in industrial labor demand specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates housing covenants and policy constraints.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Chicago and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on labor market inference from wage series simple.

8. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **attenuated** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because housing covenants and policy constraints dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like labor market inference from wage series are needed
   D. weakened

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. The passage treats segregation and redlining signatures as a confounder and push–pull dynamics as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where labor market inference from wage series constrains push–pull dynamics
   C. The discussion suggests that push–pull dynamics is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

10. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize model assumptions?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifts in industrial labor demand is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. The passage implies that newspaper archive research directly measures causes, meaning confounding from racial violence and intimidation is impossible.
   C. it prevents shifts in industrial labor demand from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control racial violence and intimidation
   D. Since shifts in industrial labor demand is observed in Philadelphia, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
