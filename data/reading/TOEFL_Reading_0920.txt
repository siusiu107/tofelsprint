Passage 0920: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 773)

Despite seemingly clear effect sizes, the analysis suggests researchers have treated
selective memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization. Even if meta-analytic synthesis can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives. Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate
or stratify cultural norms about consistency occurred when the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which meta-analytic
synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, an outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, post-
choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A]
Later comparisons reveal why this matters. by comparing cases in which meta-analytic
synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. [B] The author uses the example to separate detection from interpretation.
Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] The discussion
makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. [D] The author suggests
that the same evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ. The point is not X
but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the lesson of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—selective memory for supporting evidence—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with
confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an
endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. If anything is
responsible, it is the apparent regularity of selective memory for supporting evidence, and
therefore drives the first interpretation: selective memory for supporting evidence is
treated as a direct readout of mechanism. Provided that selective memory for supporting
evidence is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then observations from workplace
decision settings would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. So the
literature is full of such claims, and so, too, does the evidence undermine the caveat that
cultural norms about consistency might reproduce the same pattern. In this sense, dissonance
reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In replication attempts, it becomes plausible that the apparent consensus fractured
when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike workplace decision settings. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed in part
because cultural norms about consistency shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. So the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, and so, too, does
the evidence undermine treating selective memory for supporting evidence as a self-
sufficient conclusion. Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the
passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move
from description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—selective memory for
supporting evidence—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an
endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. In this
sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label. In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is
often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims
about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conditional** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Even if meta-analytic synthesis can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like implicit association tests are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence
   C. dependent on conditions
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'post-choice attitude change' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   B. The author argues that behavioral priming designs should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where behavioral priming designs constrains self-concept threat
   D. The passage treats shifted confidence judgments as a confounder and self-concept threat as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Unless one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—selective memory for supporting evidence—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence.
   A. shifted confidence judgments specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. behavioral priming designs as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. measurement reactivity alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in workplace decision settings and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on longitudinal attitude surveys simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using meta-analytic synthesis are unnecessary.
   B. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that shifted confidence judgments is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-national survey samples. Finally, it maintains that tests combining meta-analytic synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats meta-analytic synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifted confidence judgments or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting meta-analytic synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

6. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that selective memory for supporting evidence is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic selective memory for supporting evidence.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving meta-analytic synthesis.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away public versus private commitment, since variability is merely a measurement error.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This point matters because the simplest interpretation often survives only by silently restricting the range of cases under discussion.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the author’s favorite color
   B. shifted confidence judgments
   C. longitudinal attitude surveys
   D. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization

9. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that model assumptions is important mainly because:
   A. Because devaluation of rejected alternatives appears, the mechanism must be unique, so measurement reactivity can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. it prevents devaluation of rejected alternatives from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity
   C. Since devaluation of rejected alternatives is observed in workplace decision settings, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. The passage implies that meta-analytic synthesis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from measurement reactivity is impossible.
