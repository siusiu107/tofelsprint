Passage 0930: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 734)

Across different subduction segments, the passage argues that researchers have treated
transient surface deformation as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes
and slow slip. To be sure, paleoseismic trenching can make the pattern look unusually sharp,
yet the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Rarely, unless analysts began combining paleoseismic trenching with cross-site comparisons,
does one see why claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which transient surface deformation could be explained in more than
one way because, as the author notes, confounders like heterogeneous frictional properties
often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an
empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable. In this sense, megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but the apparent regularity of transient surface deformation is
what drives the first interpretation: transient surface deformation is treated as a direct
readout of mechanism. If transient surface deformation is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway is granted, then observations from the Japan Trench region would be transferable,
and disagreement would be largely technical. the literature is full of such claims—not the
caveat that heterogeneous frictional properties might reproduce the same pattern.

Admittedly, the first model can fit one dataset extremely well; nevertheless, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
heterogeneous frictional properties can shift baselines, altering whether transient surface
deformation is even comparable across cases, which means that a good fit is not the same as
a good explanation. Unless heterogeneous frictional properties is changed while the nominal
driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed
cannot be claimed with confidence. In this sense, episodic tremor and slip is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Using paleoseismic trenching under stable conditions, the argument reframes the issue so
that one frequently cited case from the Japan Trench region appeared to support the direct-
readout view. While it is true that the original fit looked visually decisive, later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in heterogeneous frictional properties altered
the baseline enough to mute or mimic transient surface deformation. the passage treats this
episode as diagnostic, which helps explain why illustrates why boundary conditions must be
specified before generalization is attempted.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of subduction-zone
megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is constrained by what competing models
would also predict. [A] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. Provided
that one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—transient
surface deformation—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. [B] The author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen
case. Whereas popular summaries treat transient surface deformation as an endpoint may be
convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. [C] The passage emphasizes boundary
conditions instead of treating them as afterthoughts. [D] This is presented not as a
loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. In this sense, slow-slip events on
plate interfaces is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and
slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery,
a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary. Even if the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer
is strong, the result is a framework in which transient surface deformation is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

   C. tsunami-generating seafloor uplift
   D. the length of the Nile in miles

2. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when stress transfer after large events can mimic tsunami-generating seafloor uplift.
   B. The author treats Sumatra–Andaman as a special case and argues that no broader inference about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip is possible.
   C. The passage suggests that tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving seafloor pressure sensors.

   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves low-frequency tremor bursts is unique.
   B. It replaces paleoseismic trenching with intuition.
   C. May be muted by other processes
   D. Adds correlated noise

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the passage juxtapose two accounts of the phenomenon?
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'episodic tremor and slip' refers to a different field altogether, not to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip.
   B. The passage treats low-frequency tremor bursts as a confounder and heterogeneous frictional properties as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The author argues that paleoseismic trenching should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where paleoseismic trenching constrains heterogeneous frictional properties

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because tsunami-generating seafloor uplift uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on continuous GPS geodesy simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Cascadia subduction zone and everywhere else.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates locked versus creeping patches.

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like stress transfer after large events make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting numerical rupture simulations as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that low-frequency tremor bursts is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how stress transfer after large events can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Chilean margin. Finally, it maintains that tests combining numerical rupture simulations with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats numerical rupture simulations as a historical curiosity and does not discuss low-frequency tremor bursts or stress transfer after large events. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that stress transfer after large events is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using numerical rupture simulations are unnecessary.

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. transient surface deformation specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. continuous GPS geodesy as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. fluid overpressure in faults alone, treated as the sole cause

9. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. Because transient surface deformation appears, the mechanism must be unique, so heterogeneous frictional properties can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. it prevents transient surface deformation from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control heterogeneous frictional properties
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if seafloor pressure sensors produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. Since transient surface deformation is observed in the Chilean margin, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
