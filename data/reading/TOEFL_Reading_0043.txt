Passage 0043: Gravitational Microlensing and What Brief Light Curves Reveal About Exoplanets (Astronomy)
========================================================================================================
(Word count: 614)

Most exoplanets have been found by watching their host stars dim or wobble. Those techniques
are powerful, yet they are biased toward planets that orbit relatively nearby stars and, in
the case of transits, planets whose orbital planes align by chance with our line of sight.
Gravitational microlensing offers a different window. Instead of detecting a planet by its
own light or by its star’s reflex motion, microlensing detects the way gravity bends light
from a more distant background star. When a foreground star passes nearly in front of a
background star, the foreground star’s gravity acts as a lens, temporarily magnifying the
background light.

The lensing geometry produces a characteristic brightening curve: the background star’s
apparent brightness rises as the alignment improves and falls as the alignment worsens. The
details depend on the mass of the lens and on the relative motion between source and lens. A
key scale is the Einstein ring radius, which sets the typical separation at which lensing is
strong. If the alignment were perfect, the background star’s image would form a ring. In
practice, it forms two distorted images whose combined brightness changes smoothly. [A] The
event can last days or weeks, and it is transient: the same star alignment will not repeat
on human time scales.

Planets reveal themselves as anomalies. If the lens star hosts a planet, the planet’s
gravity can add its own small lens, creating regions of high magnification called caustics.
When the background star’s path crosses a caustic, the light curve can show a brief bump or
dip that deviates from the single-star pattern. Because the anomaly’s duration depends on
the planet’s mass, a Jupiter-mass planet can produce a perturbation lasting a day or two,
whereas an Earth-mass planet may produce a perturbation that lasts only hours. Detecting
small planets therefore requires frequent monitoring and precise photometry.

Microlensing has a distinctive sensitivity profile. It is most sensitive to planets at
separations of a few astronomical units—roughly where giant planets often form—and it can
detect planets around faint or distant lens stars, including stars in the Galactic bulge. It
can even detect “free-floating” planets that have been ejected from their systems, because a
planet alone can act as a lens. Yet the method has limitations. Because the event is brief
and rarely repeats, follow-up characterization is difficult. One often infers planet-to-star
mass ratio and projected separation, then later tries to separate the lens star from the
source star with high-resolution imaging to estimate absolute masses.

These constraints make microlensing surveys statistical by nature. By counting how often
anomalies occur in a monitored field, researchers estimate the frequency of planets of
different masses and separations. The conclusions can diverge from those drawn by transits,
not because one is wrong, but because each samples a different region of parameter space. A
population that seems rare among close-in transiting planets may be common at wider orbits.
[B] In that way, microlensing fills a gap in our census, revealing planetary architectures
that would otherwise be undercounted.

Future space missions aim to improve microlensing by observing continuously with stable
instruments above Earth’s atmosphere. Continuous coverage reduces missed short anomalies,
and infrared sensitivity helps in crowded bulge fields. When combined with other methods,
microlensing can test models of planet formation: it can indicate whether cold super-Earths
are common, whether giant planets cluster near snow lines, and how planet frequency varies
with stellar environment. [C] Even though each event is fleeting, the accumulation of many
events can yield a durable picture of how often planetary systems build worlds in the cold,
distant regions that our own Solar System exemplifies. [D]

   B. permanent rings around stars
   C. spectral lines in atmospheric chemistry

   Sentence to insert: Because the alignment is accidental, observers must survey millions of stars to catch such events.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Factual] According to the passage, how does a planet typically appear in a microlensing light curve?
   A. as a brief perturbation caused by the planet’s gravity creating caustics
   B. as a long-term dimming that repeats every orbit
   C. as a steady change in the star’s color index
   D. as a permanent splitting of the lens star into two stars

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why detecting Earth-mass planets via microlensing is challenging?
   A. Their anomalies can last only hours, requiring frequent observations and precise photometry
   B. They never produce caustics, so no anomaly occurs
   C. They require the lens star to be very nearby
   D. They can be detected only by repeated events

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as microlensing strengths EXCEPT:
   A. sensitivity to planets at a few astronomical units
   B. ability to detect planets around faint or distant stars
   C. potential to detect free-floating planets
   D. ability to repeatedly observe the same event on demand

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author contrast microlensing with transit detections?
   A. To show that different methods sample different planetary separations and thus complement each other statistically
   B. To argue that transits are scientifically useless
   C. To claim that microlensing detects only close-in hot planets
   D. To suggest that microlensing measures planetary atmospheres directly

7. [Reference] In the passage, “these constraints” refers to microlensing’s limitations that:
   A. events are transient and rarely repeat, complicating follow-up characterization
   B. planets must transit their stars to be detected
   C. background stars must be very bright and isolated
   D. lens stars must be binary systems

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains basic microlensing geometry, describes how planets create anomalies, then discusses sensitivity, limits, and why surveys yield statistical planet frequencies
   B. It narrates the history of one telescope and stops
   C. It lists planet names without explaining detection
   D. It focuses only on stellar evolution in the bulge

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that microlensing “fills a gap in our census”?
   A. It detects planet populations—especially at wider orbits or around distant stars—that other methods tend to miss
   B. It replaces all other detection methods because it measures everything directly
   C. It is biased toward the same planets that transits find
   D. It measures only the brightness of planets, not stars

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Microlensing detects exoplanets mainly by observing repeated transits that dim a star at regular intervals.
   B. The passage explains gravitational microlensing as transient magnification of background starlight by a foreground lens, shows how planets create brief anomalies via caustics, and argues that although follow-up is difficult, large surveys and future space missions can reveal planet frequencies at wider orbits that complement other methods.
   C. Microlensing is useful only for nearby bright stars and cannot detect small planets.
   D. Einstein rings are permanent structures that mark the orbits of planets.
