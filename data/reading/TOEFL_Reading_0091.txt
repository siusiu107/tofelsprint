Passage 0091: Columnar Basalt and the Geometry of Cooling Fractures (Geology)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 642)

Walk along a cliff made of basalt, and you may find the rock broken into a honeycomb of
tall, polygonal columns, as if a mason had stacked stone prisms with mathematical patience.
Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland and Devil’s Postpile in California are famous examples,
yet similar columns appear wherever basaltic lava cools under the right circumstances. The
pattern is not carved by chisels; it is written by contraction, because molten rock shrinks
as it loses heat and, when it cannot shrink smoothly, it fractures.

Basalt begins as a fluid melt, often erupted in thick flows or pooled in lava lakes. At the
top and bottom of a flow, cooling is rapid because the lava is in contact with air or with
wet ground, and chilled margins can form quickly. In the interior, cooling is slower, and
the temperature gradient persists for months or even years. As the interior drops through
the solidification range, crystals grow, and the newly solid rock begins to contract. [A] If
the contraction were perfectly uniform, the rock would simply become slightly smaller;
however, because the solid interior is constrained by surrounding material, tensile stresses
accumulate.

Once tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the rock, cracks nucleate. These cracks
tend to form a network that, at first, is irregular, but it evolves toward a more even
spacing because closely spaced cracks relieve stress efficiently and reduce the need for
additional cracks. The result is a pattern that statistically favors hexagons, not because
nature “prefers” six, but because hexagons tile a plane with minimal perimeter for a given
area, distributing stress in a nearly even way. Pentagons and heptagons occur as well, and
the columns are rarely perfect; the underlying logic is energetic economy rather than
geometric idealism. [B] What looks like a design is, in fact, a compromise between competing
stress fields.

The cracks do not stop at the surface. As cooling continues, the fracture network propagates
downward, producing columns whose long axes are roughly perpendicular to the cooling
surface. That orientation is why columns can point upward in one outcrop but sideways in
another: they align with the direction of greatest heat loss. In a lava lake that cools from
the top, columns can grow downward; in a thin dike that cools from its walls, columns can
grow inward from both sides, meeting in a central seam. The term “columnar jointing”
emphasizes that these are joints—fractures without major displacement—rather than faults.

Cooling rate influences column size. Where cooling is slow, stress accumulates over a larger
distance before cracking becomes energetically favorable, producing thicker columns; where
cooling is fast, cracks form more closely spaced, producing thinner columns. Geologists
therefore read columns as fossilized cooling histories, even though the relationship is not
a simple ruler: the same column width can reflect different combinations of flow thickness,
water content, and thermal conductivity. [C] Still, the general trend remains visible in
basalt that cooled beneath water, where rapid quenching often yields dense sets of narrow
columns.

Columns also preserve clues about post-cooling processes. Some show curved “entablature”
zones where cooling conditions changed, perhaps because water flooded the flow or because
the flow surface broke and altered heat loss. Others display joint surfaces with striations
that record incremental crack advance, a stop-and-start process rather than a single snap.
Even the flat, step-like surfaces between segments of a column—called colonnades—can
indicate episodic cooling and fracture propagation. The rock, in other words, carries a
record not only of eruption but also of the thermal conversation between lava and its
environment.

Columnar basalt therefore offers a lesson in cause and consequence. [D] Heat loss drives
contraction; contraction drives fracture; fracture organizes itself into quasi-regular
polygons; and, long after the lava has cooled, the resulting architecture turns an ancient
thermal event into a landscape that looks improbably engineered.


Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because cracks relieve stress most effectively when they are spaced relatively evenly, the network tends to “self-correct” as it grows.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Vocabulary] The word “nucleate” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. to begin forming at a small site
   B. to dissolve into liquid again
   C. to move sideways in large blocks
   D. to become chemically inert

3. [Factual] According to the passage, what directly causes the fractures that create columnar jointing?
   A. tensile stresses created as solidifying basalt contracts during cooling
   B. erosion by wind carving polygons into soft rock
   C. chemical reactions between basalt and plant roots
   D. violent fault movement that displaces columns meters apart

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why hexagons are common but not exclusive in columnar basalt?
   A. Hexagons distribute stress efficiently in a tiling pattern, but local conditions and evolving crack growth also produce other polygons
   B. Hexagons are the only shape that can form in any cooling lava
   C. Pentagons occur only when basalt is reheated to melt
   D. Heptagons are carved later by human tools

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention outcrops where columns point sideways rather than upward?
   A. To show that column orientation follows the direction of heat loss rather than a fixed “upward” rule
   B. To argue that basalt always cools from the bottom first
   C. To suggest that erosion rotates columns after they form
   D. To claim that sideways columns indicate a different rock type

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following factors are mentioned as affecting column size or interpretation EXCEPT:
   A. cooling rate
   B. flow thickness
   C. water content
   D. the size of pollen baskets on insect legs

7. [Reference] In the passage, “a compromise between competing stress fields” refers to:
   A. the imperfect polygon network that emerges as fractures organize to relieve tensile stress efficiently
   B. a negotiated policy between fishing firms
   C. a choice between equal temperament and historical tuning
   D. a shift from slavery to freedom in law

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces the visual phenomenon, explains thermal contraction and crack formation, then discusses polygon patterns, orientation, and what variations reveal about cooling history
   B. It lists famous basalt cliffs without explaining formation
   C. It argues that polygons are carved entirely by erosion
   D. It describes only chemical weathering and omits cooling

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the author’s main causal chain?
   A. As basalt cools it contracts, the resulting tensile stress triggers fractures, and those fractures evolve into organized polygonal columns that record cooling conditions
   B. Basalt expands as it cools, causing smooth shrinking without cracks
   C. Columns form when rivers cut basalt into equal slices
   D. Columns are built by microorganisms that tile rock surfaces

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Columnar basalt is produced when erosion carves perfect hexagons into already solid rock.
   B. The passage explains columnar basalt as a fracture architecture created when cooling lava contracts, accumulates tensile stress, and forms crack networks that evolve toward roughly even spacing and polygonal tiling; it notes that column orientation reflects heat-loss direction and that column size and internal zones preserve information about cooling rates and changing environmental conditions.
   C. Polygonal columns form only in granite because basalt cannot fracture.
   D. Hexagons are common because basalt crystals grow only in six-sided shapes.
