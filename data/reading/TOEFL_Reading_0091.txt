Passage 0091: Basalt Weathering and the Long-Term Carbon Cycle (Geochemistry)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 610)

If atmospheric carbon dioxide is the currency of climate, then silicate weathering is one of
the planet’s slowest banks. When rainwater absorbs CO₂, it becomes weakly acidic, and when
that water reacts with silicate minerals, it consumes CO₂ and produces dissolved ions that
rivers transport to the sea. Over long spans, some of those ions become carbonates, locking
carbon into rock. This pathway does not act like a thermostat that reacts instantly; rather,
it is a patient feedback that has helped stabilize climate over millions of years.

Basalt, a volcanic rock rich in calcium and magnesium silicates, weathers faster than many
granites. Its minerals tend to be reactive, and fresh basalt often has abundant fractures
that admit water. [A] For this reason, geochemists have examined basaltic terrains—from
Iceland to the Deccan Traps—as natural laboratories for carbon consumption. The chemistry is
often summarized with equations, yet the outcome is visible in streams whose dissolved loads
rise after storms and in soils whose clays record altered minerals.

Weathering, however, is not governed by chemistry alone. Temperature, rainfall, and the
amount of exposed surface area matter, but so do biology and erosion. Plant roots exude
organic acids, microbes alter redox conditions, and growing forests can increase CO₂ in
soils through respiration, which intensifies the acidity of percolating water. At the same
time, if erosion is too slow, reactive minerals become coated with secondary clays that
block further reaction; if erosion is too fast, fresh rock is exposed, yet soils may be too
thin to sustain the biological accelerators. [B] Thus, the most carbon-consuming landscapes
are not always the wettest or the hottest; they are often those in which chemical reaction
and physical renewal are well matched.

This coupling becomes especially interesting when tectonics enters the story. Mountain
building can increase erosion and expose fresh minerals, potentially raising weathering
rates and drawing down CO₂. Yet uplift also changes rainfall patterns, and the result can
vary by region. In some basins, intense monsoon rains enhance runoff and transport; in
others, rain shadows limit water, slowing reaction despite newly exposed rock. Geological
processes supply the raw material, but climate and ecology decide how quickly the material
is spent.

Because weathering is slow, scientists debate what it can do in the near term. Proposals for
“enhanced weathering” imagine crushing basalt and spreading it on fields or coastlines to
speed reaction and remove CO₂. The concept borrows from natural processes, but scaling is
difficult. Crushing requires energy, transport emits CO₂, and the chemical benefits depend
on how rapidly particles dissolve and how the resulting alkalinity is managed in waterways.
[C] Even if the chemistry is favorable, social and logistical constraints can determine
whether the practice is meaningful rather than symbolic.

Basalt weathering therefore illustrates a larger point about Earth’s carbon cycle: some of
the most consequential controls operate quietly, through reactions that are individually
small but cumulatively immense. [D] Understanding them requires following carbon from air to
rain, from soil to stream, and from ocean chemistry into stone.

Because weathering is slow, the relevant question is not whether it works in a year but
whether it can matter across millennia.

In river deltas, some dissolved ions are buried as carbonates, which quietly turns a
chemical reaction into a geological archive.
