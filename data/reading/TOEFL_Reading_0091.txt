Passage 0091: Basalt Weathering and the Long-Term Carbon Cycle (Geochemistry)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 610)

If atmospheric carbon dioxide is the currency of climate, then silicate weathering is one of
the planet’s slowest banks. When rainwater absorbs CO₂, it becomes weakly acidic, and when
that water reacts with silicate minerals, it consumes CO₂ and produces dissolved ions that
rivers transport to the sea. Over long spans, some of those ions become carbonates, locking
carbon into rock. This pathway does not act like a thermostat that reacts instantly; rather,
it is a patient feedback that has helped stabilize climate over millions of years.

Basalt, a volcanic rock rich in calcium and magnesium silicates, weathers faster than many
granites. Its minerals tend to be reactive, and fresh basalt often has abundant fractures
that admit water. [A] For this reason, geochemists have examined basaltic terrains—from
Iceland to the Deccan Traps—as natural laboratories for carbon consumption. The chemistry is
often summarized with equations, yet the outcome is visible in streams whose dissolved loads
rise after storms and in soils whose clays record altered minerals.

Weathering, however, is not governed by chemistry alone. Temperature, rainfall, and the
amount of exposed surface area matter, but so do biology and erosion. Plant roots exude
organic acids, microbes alter redox conditions, and growing forests can increase CO₂ in
soils through respiration, which intensifies the acidity of percolating water. At the same
time, if erosion is too slow, reactive minerals become coated with secondary clays that
block further reaction; if erosion is too fast, fresh rock is exposed, yet soils may be too
thin to sustain the biological accelerators. [B] Thus, the most carbon-consuming landscapes
are not always the wettest or the hottest; they are often those in which chemical reaction
and physical renewal are well matched.

This coupling becomes especially interesting when tectonics enters the story. Mountain
building can increase erosion and expose fresh minerals, potentially raising weathering
rates and drawing down CO₂. Yet uplift also changes rainfall patterns, and the result can
vary by region. In some basins, intense monsoon rains enhance runoff and transport; in
others, rain shadows limit water, slowing reaction despite newly exposed rock. Geological
processes supply the raw material, but climate and ecology decide how quickly the material
is spent.

Because weathering is slow, scientists debate what it can do in the near term. Proposals for
“enhanced weathering” imagine crushing basalt and spreading it on fields or coastlines to
speed reaction and remove CO₂. The concept borrows from natural processes, but scaling is
difficult. Crushing requires energy, transport emits CO₂, and the chemical benefits depend
on how rapidly particles dissolve and how the resulting alkalinity is managed in waterways.
[C] Even if the chemistry is favorable, social and logistical constraints can determine
whether the practice is meaningful rather than symbolic.

Basalt weathering therefore illustrates a larger point about Earth’s carbon cycle: some of
the most consequential controls operate quietly, through reactions that are individually
small but cumulatively immense. [D] Understanding them requires following carbon from air to
rain, from soil to stream, and from ocean chemistry into stone.

Because weathering is slow, the relevant question is not whether it works in a year but
whether it can matter across millennia.

In river deltas, some dissolved ions are buried as carbonates, which quietly turns a
chemical reaction into a geological archive.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: At the same time, if erosion is too slow, reactive minerals become coated with secondary clays that block further reaction; if erosion is too fast, fresh rock is exposed, yet soils may be too thin to sustain the biological accelerators.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across carbon
   B. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of carbon
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to whether and reaction

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains weathering by linking whether to reaction, and it shows why carbon changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage concedes that whether is often incomplete and concludes that weathering cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since carbon overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of reaction with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage presents reaction as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once whether is observed, competing explanations for weathering collapse. It treats carbon as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   D. The passage surveys weathering but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed reaction first, with whether serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats carbon as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, in the setting discussed.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in carbon, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of whether is enough to validate reaction for weathering, especially regarding minerals, especially regarding minerals.
   B. The passage implies that carbon mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes whether effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of reaction no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain weathering, especially regarding whether.
   C. The passage treats whether primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over reaction are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about weathering are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how weathering should change if carbon is altered, instead of assuming that whether has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to reaction must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of carbon as a factor influencing whether, especially regarding weathering.
   B. discussion of weathering as a factor influencing whether
   C. discussion of reaction as a factor influencing whether
   D. discussion of granular convection as a factor influencing whether

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: At the same time, if erosion is too slow, reactive minerals become coated with secondary clays that block further reaction; if erosion is too fast, fresh rock is exposed, yet soils may be too thin to sustain the biological accelerators.
   A. At the same time, if erosion is too slow, reactive minerals become coated with secondary clays that block further reaction. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. At the same time, if erosion is too slow, reactive minerals become coated with secondary clays that block further reaction. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, as framed by the author, as the discussion implies.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, especially regarding carbon, especially regarding water.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of reaction guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in carbon are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because whether directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding weathering.
   C. Because once whether fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and carbon can be ignored without changing conclusions about weathering.
   D. Because comparability prevents reaction from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold carbon constant while examining whether.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | whether | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | carbon | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It proves reaction is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that weathering should be read alongside carbon, because whether alone does not settle what reaction means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This pathway does not act like a thermostat that reacts instantly; rather, it is a patient feedback that has helped stabilize climate over millions of years.
   A. the idea that Because weathering is slow, the relevant question is not whether it works in a year but whether it can matter across millennia.
   B. the idea that Over long spans, some of those ions become carbonates, locking carbon into rock, for the phenomenon at issue.
   C. the idea that Basalt, a volcanic rock rich in calcium and magnesium silicates, weathers faster than many granites, in the examples provided.
   D. the idea that When rainwater absorbs CO₂, it becomes weakly acidic, and when that water reacts with silicate minerals, it consumes CO₂ and produces dissolved ions that...
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses reaction, so debate over whether is unnecessary noise, especially regarding reaction.
   B. to show that the term weathering belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of whether and reaction should be abandoned altogether, especially regarding carbon.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of whether lead to different conclusions about weathering.
