Passage 0823: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 719)

Against that intuitive story, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated disparate exposure to pollution as the decisive sign of residential
segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality. Granted that quasi-experimental
policy evaluation can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, something that
forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were
applied in settings unlike European migrant neighborhoods. the same summary statistic could
be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely because credit market
discrimination shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. Rather than
treating disparate exposure to pollution as a self-sufficient conclusion, the passage
emphasizes that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense,
spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify credit market discrimination
did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which quasi-experimental policy evaluation constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, a move that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can be dramatic, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative.

Not until analysts began combining quasi-experimental policy evaluation with cross-site
comparisons was it clear that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. [A] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction
follows. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate exposure to pollution could
be explained in more than one way because confounders like credit market discrimination
often co-vary with the driver. [B] The author notes that generalization requires more than a
single well-chosen case. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable. [C] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. [D]
This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. In this sense,
segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify credit market
discrimination was it defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive
rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which quasi-experimental policy
evaluation constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. Even if a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of residential
segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—disparate exposure to pollution—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint may be convenient, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is
scientifically revealing. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about residential
segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even though
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which disparate exposure to pollution is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like zoning rules and land-use regulation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting mobility tracking with administrative records as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how zoning rules and land-use regulation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from European migrant neighborhoods. Finally, it maintains that tests combining mobility tracking with administrative records with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats mobility tracking with administrative records as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or zoning rules and land-use regulation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that zoning rules and land-use regulation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using mobility tracking with administrative records are unnecessary.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the length of the Nile in miles
   B. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   C. wealth accumulation gaps
   D. quasi-experimental policy evaluation

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in large U.S. metropolitan areas and everywhere else.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates zoning rules and land-use regulation.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on longitudinal panel data simple.

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using spatial autocorrelation analysis.
   B. The author treats rapidly growing Sun Belt regions as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   C. The passage suggests that school-quality gradients is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when informational asymmetries in housing search can mimic school-quality gradients.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **tentative** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.
   A. not certain
   B. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like longitudinal panel data are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because credit market discrimination dominates all evidence

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. spatial autocorrelation analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. wealth accumulation gaps specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. zoning rules and land-use regulation alone, treated as the sole cause

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | longitudinal panel data | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | disparate exposure to pollution | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | zoning rules and land-use regulation | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. May be muted by other processes
   B. It makes path dependence from historical redlining irrelevant.
   C. Adds correlated noise
   D. Can introduce systematic bias

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. Since school-quality gradients is observed in post-industrial cities, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. it prevents school-quality gradients from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control informational asymmetries in housing search
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once school-quality gradients is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. Because informational asymmetries in housing search co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The discussion suggests that zoning rules and land-use regulation is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The author argues that audit studies in housing markets should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage implies that rapidly growing Sun Belt regions is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where audit studies in housing markets constrains zoning rules and land-use regulation

10. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
