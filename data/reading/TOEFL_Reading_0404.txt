Passage 0404: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 768)

In classic laboratory tasks, the passage argues that researchers have treated shifted
confidence judgments as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. To be sure, implicit association tests can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, yet the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather
than rely on familiar narratives. Working with sparse records and limited controls on self-
concept threat, it is difficult to deny that many early studies framed cognitive dissonance
and post-decision rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies
emphasized shifted confidence judgments as a signature may be convenient, later work asked
whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ is scientifically
revealing. this shift mattered for how evidence from consumer choice studies was generalized
because local conditions can change which processes generate shifted confidence judgments.
In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label. Using implicit association tests under stable conditions, it is
difficult to deny that one frequently cited case from consumer choice studies appeared to
support the direct-readout view. Despite the fact that the original fit looked visually
decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in self-concept threat altered
the baseline enough to mute or mimic shifted confidence judgments. the passage treats this
episode as diagnostic, an outcome that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted. Using implicit association tests under stable
conditions, it is difficult to deny that one frequently cited case from consumer choice
studies appeared to support the direct-readout view. Admittedly, the original fit looked
visually decisive; nevertheless, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in
self-concept threat altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic shifted confidence
judgments. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, an outcome that illustrates why
boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. The point is not X
but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the lesson of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. [A] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a
disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Were one wishes to move from description to
explanation to fail, then the same observation—shifted confidence judgments—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The passage highlights
that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. Whereas popular summaries treat
shifted confidence judgments as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. [C] The
author uses the example to separate detection from interpretation. [D] The argument hinges
on what would change under an alternative explanation. In this sense, dissonance reduction
after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept
threat. by comparing cases in which implicit association tests constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, a move that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can
be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. Rarely has it been the case that claims about cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions, at least before analysts began combining implicit
association tests with cross-site comparisons. the goal was to break degeneracies in which
shifted confidence judgments could be explained in more than one way in part because
confounders like self-concept threat often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in
turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, self-
justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This point matters because the simplest interpretation often survives only by silently restricting the range of cases under discussion.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if longitudinal attitude surveys produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
   C. Since selective memory for supporting evidence is observed in cross-national survey samples, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because selective memory for supporting evidence appears, the mechanism must be unique, so public versus private commitment can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

3. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | meta-analytic synthesis | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | selective memory for supporting evidence | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | measurement reactivity | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It makes measurement reactivity irrelevant.
   B. May be muted by other processes
   C. Samples only part of the system
   D. It replaces meta-analytic synthesis with intuition.

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conspicuous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In classic laboratory tasks, the passage argues that researchers have treated shifted confidence judgments as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   A. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like implicit association tests are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence
   D. easy to notice

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where behavioral priming designs constrains self-concept threat
   B. The passage treats increased liking for chosen options as a confounder and self-concept threat as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The discussion suggests that self-concept threat is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The author argues that behavioral priming designs should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

6. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when measurement reactivity can mimic devaluation of rejected alternatives.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away measurement reactivity, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving longitudinal attitude surveys.
   D. The passage suggests that devaluation of rejected alternatives is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates cultural norms about consistency.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on meta-analytic synthesis simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.

8. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. a recipe for bread fermentation
   B. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   C. longitudinal attitude surveys
   D. devaluation of rejected alternatives

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats meta-analytic synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss devaluation of rejected alternatives or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that devaluation of rejected alternatives is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining meta-analytic synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   C. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using meta-analytic synthesis are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting meta-analytic synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

10. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. public versus private commitment alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. shifted confidence judgments specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. meta-analytic synthesis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
