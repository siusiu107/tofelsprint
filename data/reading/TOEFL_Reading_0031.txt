Passage 0031: Slow Slip on Subduction Faults and the Hidden Ways Plates Release Stress (Geology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 667)

Along the edge of a continent, where an oceanic plate dives beneath a lighter plate, the
boundary is not a single clean fault but a broad zone in which rocks grind, deform, and, at
times, suddenly rupture. For decades, seismologists pictured this boundary as a simple
alternation: either it was locked, accumulating strain for a future earthquake, or it
slipped quietly, releasing strain without shaking. That tidy picture began to erode when
instruments became precise enough to notice motions that were neither explosive nor silent
in the old sense.

In several subduction zones, networks of GPS receivers revealed episodes in which the ground
moved a few millimeters to a few centimeters over days to weeks, often in a direction
opposite to the long-term plate convergence. The movement was too slow to produce ordinary
seismic waves, yet too organized to be dismissed as noise. These events—slow slip—were
sometimes accompanied by faint, tremor-like vibrations that lacked the sharp, high-frequency
onset of typical quakes. [A] The paired signal suggested that parts of the fault were
slipping while nearby patches were repeatedly failing in tiny, low-stress bursts.

Why would a fault slip slowly instead of snapping? One reason is that friction along a plate
boundary is not uniform. Laboratory experiments show that some materials strengthen when
they begin to slide, tending toward stable creep, while others weaken with slip, favoring
runaway rupture. Temperature and pressure change with depth, altering mineral structures and
the presence of fluids. In many subduction zones, the slow-slip region sits at depths where
sediments have been squeezed and heated enough to release water. That water can raise pore
pressure, effectively reducing the normal stress that clamps the fault shut, so sliding
becomes easier even when the tectonic forces have not changed.

Fluids alone do not guarantee slow motion; they interact with the fault’s patchwork. If a
boundary contains isolated asperities—stronger patches surrounded by weaker, more lubricated
material—then a slow episode can propagate as a front, loading and unloading those patches
in sequence. A patch that is nearly ready to fail may emit tremor as it repeatedly stutters.
A stronger patch may remain locked and simply be stressed by the surrounding slip, storing
strain for the next large rupture. [B] Slow slip, then, can be both a release and a
reorganization of stress, depending on where it occurs.

These events matter because they occupy the same tectonic system as damaging earthquakes. In
some regions, slow slip appears to increase the probability of a larger event by
transferring stress toward the shallower locked zone. In other cases, slow slip may
partially relieve stress that would otherwise accumulate. The difference is not a
philosophical debate; it is a question of geometry and timing. If slow slip occurs downdip
from a locked patch, it can pull on that patch like a hand tightening a rubber band. If it
occurs within a patch that might otherwise rupture, it can bleed off strain, delaying
failure.

Scientists have begun to map slow-slip recurrence, noting that some segments repeat on
remarkably regular intervals—every year, for example—while others are erratic. The
regularity hints that the controlling ingredients, such as fluid supply and rock type,
evolve predictably, but even regular segments can shift if sediment influx or temperature
gradients change. [C] Moreover, a “repeat” event can vary in area and duration, reminding
researchers that the fault behaves like a living system rather than like a clock.

Understanding slow slip has practical consequences for monitoring. Because slow events are
detectable through continuous GPS and sensitive seismometers, they provide real-time
evidence that stress is moving along the boundary. A slow episode does not announce that a
great earthquake will follow, yet it changes the state of the system in a measurable way.
[D] In the logic of hazards, that is valuable: it is a window into the fault’s internal
negotiations, in which friction, fluids, and rock fabric decide whether the next release
will be a gentle slide or a violent break.

---------

1. [Vocabulary] The word “asperities” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. strong, resistant patches on a fault
   B. ocean waves near the coast
   C. chemical impurities in water
   D. satellite-based receivers

2. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the motion unfolds over days, its signature appears as a gradual drift rather than as a sharp jolt.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Factual] According to the passage, why can released water within subducting sediments promote sliding?
   A. It raises pore pressure, reducing the effective stress that clamps the fault
   B. It cools the fault so minerals become stronger
   C. It eliminates friction by dissolving rock completely
   D. It increases plate convergence speed

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why slow-slip episodes may affect earthquake hazard differently in different places?
   A. Their impact depends on where stress is transferred relative to locked patches and on timing
   B. Slow slip always triggers a large earthquake within hours
   C. Slow slip happens only at the surface and cannot influence deeper regions
   D. Hazard depends only on how often tremor occurs

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention laboratory friction experiments?
   A. To explain that different materials respond differently to sliding, helping account for slow versus fast slip
   B. To argue that field measurements are unreliable
   C. To show that fluids never matter in faults
   D. To claim that earthquakes are caused by GPS instruments

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are discussed as influences on slow slip EXCEPT:
   A. fluids and pore pressure
   B. fault patchiness and strong segments
   C. depth-related temperature and pressure
   D. radioactive decay in bone collagen

7. [Reference] In the passage, “that tidy picture” refers to the idea that plate boundaries:
   A. are either locked for big quakes or slip quietly with no intermediate behavior
   B. never accumulate strain
   C. only rupture in the deep mantle
   D. can be monitored only after earthquakes

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces a revised view of subduction faults, describes observations of slow slip, explains mechanisms, then discusses hazard implications and monitoring value
   B. It presents a chronological biography of a scientist
   C. It lists subduction zones without explaining processes
   D. It compares earthquakes only to volcanic eruptions

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that slow slip can be “a release and a reorganization of stress”?
   A. Slow slip may reduce strain locally while shifting stress onto other fault patches
   B. Slow slip removes all stress everywhere permanently
   C. Slow slip is identical to a large earthquake but quieter
   D. Slow slip occurs only when plates stop moving

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Slow slip is random instrument noise with no tectonic meaning.
   B. The passage explains slow slip as measurable, days-to-weeks fault motion often linked with tremor, describes how frictional properties and fluids can favor slow behavior in patchy fault zones, and shows why such events matter because they redistribute stress within subduction systems relevant to earthquake hazard.
   C. All subduction zones slip steadily and never lock.
   D. Slow slip proves that large earthquakes cannot occur in subduction zones.
