Passage 0031: Slow Slip on Subduction Faults and the Hidden Ways Plates Release Stress (Geology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 667)

Along the edge of a continent, where an oceanic plate dives beneath a lighter plate, the
boundary is not a single clean fault but a broad zone in which rocks grind, deform, and, at
times, suddenly rupture. For decades, seismologists pictured this boundary as a simple
alternation: either it was locked, accumulating strain for a future earthquake, or it
slipped quietly, releasing strain without shaking. That tidy picture began to erode when
instruments became precise enough to notice motions that were neither explosive nor silent
in the old sense.

In several subduction zones, networks of GPS receivers revealed episodes in which the ground
moved a few millimeters to a few centimeters over days to weeks, often in a direction
opposite to the long-term plate convergence. The movement was too slow to produce ordinary
seismic waves, yet too organized to be dismissed as noise. These events—slow slip—were
sometimes accompanied by faint, tremor-like vibrations that lacked the sharp, high-frequency
onset of typical quakes. [A] The paired signal suggested that parts of the fault were
slipping while nearby patches were repeatedly failing in tiny, low-stress bursts.

Why would a fault slip slowly instead of snapping? One reason is that friction along a plate
boundary is not uniform. Laboratory experiments show that some materials strengthen when
they begin to slide, tending toward stable creep, while others weaken with slip, favoring
runaway rupture. Temperature and pressure change with depth, altering mineral structures and
the presence of fluids. In many subduction zones, the slow-slip region sits at depths where
sediments have been squeezed and heated enough to release water. That water can raise pore
pressure, effectively reducing the normal stress that clamps the fault shut, so sliding
becomes easier even when the tectonic forces have not changed.

Fluids alone do not guarantee slow motion; they interact with the fault’s patchwork. If a
boundary contains isolated asperities—stronger patches surrounded by weaker, more lubricated
material—then a slow episode can propagate as a front, loading and unloading those patches
in sequence. A patch that is nearly ready to fail may emit tremor as it repeatedly stutters.
A stronger patch may remain locked and simply be stressed by the surrounding slip, storing
strain for the next large rupture. [B] Slow slip, then, can be both a release and a
reorganization of stress, depending on where it occurs.

These events matter because they occupy the same tectonic system as damaging earthquakes. In
some regions, slow slip appears to increase the probability of a larger event by
transferring stress toward the shallower locked zone. In other cases, slow slip may
partially relieve stress that would otherwise accumulate. The difference is not a
philosophical debate; it is a question of geometry and timing. If slow slip occurs downdip
from a locked patch, it can pull on that patch like a hand tightening a rubber band. If it
occurs within a patch that might otherwise rupture, it can bleed off strain, delaying
failure.

Scientists have begun to map slow-slip recurrence, noting that some segments repeat on
remarkably regular intervals—every year, for example—while others are erratic. The
regularity hints that the controlling ingredients, such as fluid supply and rock type,
evolve predictably, but even regular segments can shift if sediment influx or temperature
gradients change. [C] Moreover, a “repeat” event can vary in area and duration, reminding
researchers that the fault behaves like a living system rather than like a clock.

Understanding slow slip has practical consequences for monitoring. Because slow events are
detectable through continuous GPS and sensitive seismometers, they provide real-time
evidence that stress is moving along the boundary. A slow episode does not announce that a
great earthquake will follow, yet it changes the state of the system in a measurable way.
[D] In the logic of hazards, that is valuable: it is a window into the fault’s internal
negotiations, in which friction, fluids, and rock fabric decide whether the next release
will be a gentle slide or a violent break.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "erratic" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Scientists have begun to map slow-slip recurrence, noting that some segments repeat on remarkably regular intervals—every year, for example—while others are erratic.
   A. secondary background detail, despite references to boundary and stress
   B. unpredictable and irregular, as used to describe how the claim holds across patch
   C. fully settled and final, which would rule out further evaluation of patch
   D. smooth and consistent, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related, in the examples provided.

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains fault by linking boundary to stress, and it shows why patch changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents stress as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once boundary is observed, competing explanations for fault collapse. It treats patch as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding boundary.
   C. The passage concedes that boundary is often incomplete and concludes that fault cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since patch overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of stress with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   D. The passage surveys fault but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed stress first, with boundary serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats patch as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how fault should change if patch is altered, instead of assuming that boundary has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to stress must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage treats boundary primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over stress are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about fault are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. The passage implies that patch mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes boundary effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of stress no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain fault, for the phenomenon at issue, especially regarding patch, especially regarding plate.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in patch, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of boundary is enough to validate stress for fault.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of fault as a factor influencing boundary, within the passage’s scope.
   B. discussion of patch as a factor influencing boundary
   C. discussion of stress as a factor influencing boundary
   D. discussion of contact-zone multilingualism as a factor influencing boundary

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] In the logic of hazards, that is valuable: it is a window into the fault’s internal negotiations, in which friction, fluids, and rock fabric decide whether the next release will be a gentle slide or a violent break.
   A. [D] In the logic of hazards. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. [D] In the logic of hazards. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents stress from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold patch constant while examining boundary.
   B. Because the presence of stress guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in patch are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because once boundary fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and patch can be ignored without changing conclusions about fault.
   D. Because boundary directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding fault.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | boundary | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | patch | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It proves stress is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that fault should be read alongside patch, because boundary alone does not settle what stress means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: These events—slow slip—were sometimes accompanied by faint, tremor-like vibrations that lacked the sharp, high-frequency onset of typical quakes.
   A. the preceding claim that fault functions as a direct measurement of stress
   B. the preceding claim that patch alone explains the outcome of fault
   C. the preceding claim about how boundary is interpreted in relation to stress
   D. the preceding claim that boundary is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses stress, so debate over boundary is unnecessary noise, as the argument develops.
   B. to show that the term fault belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, in the examples provided.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of boundary lead to different conclusions about fault.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of boundary and stress should be abandoned altogether.
