Passage 0790: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 785)

Across multiple northern cities, one sees why researchers have treated shifts in industrial
labor demand as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban transformation.
Even though labor market inference from wage series can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Using labor market inference
from wage series under stable conditions, the author treats the complication as diagnostic,
so one frequently cited case from Detroit appeared to support the direct-readout view. To be
sure, the original fit looked visually decisive, yet later, however, reanalysis showed that
small shifts in housing covenants and policy constraints altered the baseline enough to mute
or mimic shifts in industrial labor demand. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic,
which is precisely why illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted. In this sense, african american internal migration is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Working with sparse records
and limited controls on housing covenants and policy constraints, the argument reframes the
issue so that many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban
transformation as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized shifts in
industrial labor demand as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under
replication. this shift mattered for how evidence from Detroit was generalized in part
because local conditions can change which processes generate shifts in industrial labor
demand. Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify housing covenants and
policy constraints did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. [A] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid
overclaiming. by comparing cases in which labor market inference from wage series constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is
precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B]
The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as an
embarrassment. While it is true that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny
the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] At
first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. [D] The
discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. It is
methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage presents as
the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—shifts in industrial labor demand—must
be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed
with confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat shifts in industrial labor demand as an
endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. In this sense, south-
to-north population movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label. Using labor market inference from wage series under stable conditions, the key
question becomes whether one frequently cited case from Detroit appeared to support the
direct-readout view. Even though the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in housing covenants and policy constraints altered the
baseline enough to mute or mimic shifts in industrial labor demand. the passage treats this
episode as diagnostic, a move that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted. Not until analysts began combining labor market
inference from wage series with cross-site comparisons did claims about the great migration
and northern urban transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which shifts in industrial
labor demand could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like
housing covenants and policy constraints often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move
that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, twentieth-century
black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | labor market inference from wage series | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | segregation and redlining signatures | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | wartime industry demand | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It makes racial violence and intimidation irrelevant.
   B. It replaces labor market inference from wage series with intuition.
   C. Can mimic the target feature
   D. Requires careful calibration

2. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats Harlem as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when push–pull dynamics can mimic changes in neighborhood composition.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using housing record reconstruction.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away push–pull dynamics, since variability is merely a measurement error.

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **approximate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like newspaper archive research are needed
   B. rough
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because housing covenants and policy constraints dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. wartime industry demand alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. oral history synthesis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. changes in neighborhood composition specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: To be sure, the original fit looked visually decisive, yet later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in housing covenants and policy constraints altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic shifts in industrial labor demand.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates wartime industry demand.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on oral history synthesis simple.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Harlem and everywhere else.

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   B. changes in neighborhood composition
   C. newspaper archive research
   D. the author’s favorite color

8. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. Since segregation and redlining signatures is observed in Detroit, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. it prevents segregation and redlining signatures from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control push–pull dynamics
   C. The passage implies that oral history synthesis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from push–pull dynamics is impossible.
   D. Because segregation and redlining signatures appears, the mechanism must be unique, so push–pull dynamics can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The passage treats political realignment patterns as a confounder and housing covenants and policy constraints as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The discussion suggests that housing covenants and policy constraints is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The author argues that housing record reconstruction should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where housing record reconstruction constrains housing covenants and policy constraints

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that changes in neighborhood composition is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how racial violence and intimidation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Philadelphia. Finally, it maintains that tests combining labor market inference from wage series with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   B. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that racial violence and intimidation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using labor market inference from wage series are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like racial violence and intimidation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting labor market inference from wage series as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats labor market inference from wage series as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in neighborhood composition or racial violence and intimidation. It ends without any methodological implication.
