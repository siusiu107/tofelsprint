Passage 0087: The Freedmen’s Bureau and the Architecture of Reconstruction (U.S. History)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 616)

When the Civil War ended, emancipation created freedom in law but not immediately in lived
reality. Four million formerly enslaved people faced questions that were both urgent and
structural: where to live, how to earn wages, how to reunite families, and how to secure
education in a society that had long criminalized their literacy. In 1865 the federal
government created the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands—commonly called the
Freedmen’s Bureau—to assist in the transition from slavery to freedom. Its reach was uneven
and its lifespan short, yet its experiments reveal what Reconstruction attempted and what it
could not sustain.

The Bureau operated through field offices staffed by agents who negotiated labor contracts,
distributed rations, supervised abandoned lands, and sometimes adjudicated disputes. In
practice, agents occupied a difficult position. They were expected to protect freedpeople’s
rights, yet they depended on cooperation from local whites, and they worked in a political
environment in which northern commitment to Reconstruction waxed and waned. [A] Even when
policy was ambitious on paper, implementation could shrink under hostility, distance, and
limited personnel.

Education became one of the Bureau’s most visible arenas. Northern missionary societies and
Black communities themselves established schools, and the Bureau often provided buildings,
transportation, or salaries. Freedpeople sought education with striking intensity: adults
attended night classes after field labor, and children crowded into makeshift rooms. For
many, literacy was not merely a skill; it was a claim to citizenship, a way to read
contracts, to interpret laws, and to participate in politics. Teachers, however, worked
under threat. Schoolhouses were burned, instructors were harassed, and local authorities
sometimes refused protection.

Land was the most contested promise. During the war, some freedpeople had occupied land
abandoned by Confederate owners, and rumors spread that “forty acres and a mule” would
become policy. The Bureau did oversee some land redistribution and leasing, but President
Andrew Johnson’s pardons returned much property to former Confederates, forcing many freed
families off plots they had begun to farm. The result was a shift toward labor arrangements
such as sharecropping, which offered autonomy in daily work compared with gang labor but
also trapped families in debt through crop liens and volatile cotton prices. [B] Freedom
could exist alongside new forms of economic dependency.

The Bureau also created courts or supported military tribunals to address violence and
contract disputes when local courts were hostile to Black testimony. Yet federal authority
was limited, and as southern states adopted Black Codes and later used violence to suppress
political participation, protection was inconsistent. Congressional Reconstruction and the
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments expanded formal rights, but the enforcement capacity
remained vulnerable to political retreat.

By 1872 the Bureau was dissolved. Critics had long accused it of overreach, while supporters
argued that its work was unfinished. In hindsight, the Bureau looks like an institution
attempting to build citizenship infrastructure under adversarial conditions. It offered
resources and leverage, but it could not by itself transform land ownership patterns or
eliminate racial violence. [C] Still, the schools it supported and the contracts it
monitored left traces, and those traces shaped Black political life during Reconstruction
and beyond.

The Freedmen’s Bureau, then, is best remembered neither as a perfect guardian nor as a mere
failure. [D] It was an early, contested experiment in federal responsibility for civil
rights, showing how policy, local power, and economic structure can combine to define the
distance between emancipation and equality.

In some counties, a single teacher trained by the Bureau educated dozens of adults at night,
stitching literacy into postwar routines.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "volatile" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The result was a shift toward labor arrangements such as sharecropping, which offered autonomy in daily work compared with gang labor but also trapped families in debt through crop liens and volatile cotton prices.
   A. steady and essentially unchanging, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related, for the main claim of the text.
   B. complete and final, which would rule out further evaluation of labor
   C. secondary background detail, despite references to literacy and reconstruction, as framed by the author.
   D. likely to change suddenly or unpredictably, as used to describe how the claim holds across labor

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that literacy is often incomplete and concludes that bureau cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since labor overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of reconstruction with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage presents reconstruction as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once literacy is observed, competing explanations for bureau collapse. It treats labor as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding political.
   C. The passage surveys bureau but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed reconstruction first, with literacy serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats labor as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   D. The passage explains bureau by linking literacy to reconstruction, and it shows why labor changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how bureau should change if labor is altered, instead of assuming that literacy has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to reconstruction must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage treats literacy primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over reconstruction are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about bureau are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. The passage implies that labor mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes literacy effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of reconstruction no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain bureau, especially regarding reconstruction, especially regarding political, for the phenomenon at issue.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in labor, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of literacy is enough to validate reconstruction for bureau.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of reconstruction as a factor influencing literacy
   B. discussion of labor as a factor influencing literacy, especially regarding political.
   C. discussion of contact-zone multilingualism as a factor influencing literacy
   D. discussion of bureau as a factor influencing literacy

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Four million formerly enslaved people faced questions that were both urgent and structural: where to live, how to earn wages, how to reunite families, and how to secure education in a society that had long criminalized their literacy.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, in the setting discussed, especially regarding political.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, especially regarding local.
   C. Four million formerly enslaved people faced questions that were both urgent and structural: where to live. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   D. Four million formerly enslaved people faced questions that were both urgent and structural: where to live. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of reconstruction guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in labor are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because literacy directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding bureau.
   C. Because once literacy fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and labor can be ignored without changing conclusions about bureau.
   D. Because comparability prevents reconstruction from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold labor constant while examining literacy.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | literacy | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | labor | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It proves reconstruction is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that bureau should be read alongside labor, because literacy alone does not settle what reconstruction means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "it" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Its reach was uneven and its lifespan short, yet its experiments reveal what Reconstruction attempted and what it could not sustain.
   A. the idea that Northern missionary societies and Black communities themselves established schools, and the Bureau often provided buildings, transportation, or salaries, under the stated assumptions, given the evidence cited, in the cases described.
   B. the idea that In 1865 the federal government created the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands—commonly called the Freedmen’s Bureau—to assist in the transition from slavery...
   C. the idea that Four million formerly enslaved people faced questions that were both urgent and structural: where to live, how to earn wages, how to reunite families,
   D. the idea that The Bureau operated through field offices staffed by agents who negotiated labor contracts, distributed rations, supervised abandoned lands, and sometimes adjudicated disputes
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of literacy and reconstruction should be abandoned altogether, in the context of the passage.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses reconstruction, so debate over literacy is unnecessary noise, especially regarding reconstruction.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of literacy lead to different conclusions about bureau.
   D. to show that the term bureau belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
