Passage 0039: Sickle-Cell Trait, Malaria, and Why Harmful Alleles Can Persist (Medicine)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 666)

In regions where malaria is common, a genetic variant that would otherwise be harmful can
persist at surprisingly high frequency. The variant is the sickle-cell allele, a change in
the gene that encodes part of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood
cells. People who inherit two copies of the allele (one from each parent) often develop
sickle cell disease, a serious condition in which red blood cells become misshapen, block
small vessels, and break down prematurely. Yet people who inherit only one copy—carrying the
trait—often show increased resistance to severe malaria. The pattern is a classic case of
balancing selection, in which a disadvantage in one genetic state is offset by an advantage
in another.

Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted by mosquitoes, spends part of its life
cycle inside red blood cells. After invading, the parasite digests hemoglobin and
replicates, eventually causing the cell to rupture and release new parasites. Severe disease
is not only about parasite numbers; it is also about how infected cells interact with blood
vessels. Some parasites induce infected red cells to stick to vessel walls, avoiding
clearance by the spleen but creating blockages that can damage organs. [A] Survival
therefore depends on both parasite biology and the host’s blood-cell properties.

In sickle-cell trait carriers, several mechanisms can reduce the parasite’s success. One
involves oxygen tension. In low oxygen conditions, trait carriers’ red cells are more likely
to assume a partial sickle shape. Even a slight deformation can trigger changes that mark
the cell for removal by the spleen. If an infected cell is cleared earlier, the parasite has
less time to replicate. Another mechanism involves the internal chemistry of the cell. The
altered hemoglobin can promote oxidative stress, creating an environment that is hostile to
parasite growth. Additionally, infected trait cells may display parasite proteins
differently on their surfaces, reducing the ability of infected cells to adhere to vessel
walls. These effects are modest individually, but together they can shift the odds away from
severe outcomes.

The evolutionary arithmetic is ruthless. In a high-malaria environment, the risk of death
from malaria in early childhood can be substantial. If carrying one sickle-cell allele
reduces that risk even slightly, carriers may leave more descendants, increasing the
allele’s frequency. But if the allele becomes too common, more children inherit two copies
and suffer sickle cell disease, which reduces survival and reproduction. [B] The population
can reach an equilibrium where the allele persists because the trait’s protection offsets
the disease’s cost.

This dynamic also explains geographic patterns. The sickle-cell allele is common in parts of
sub‑Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean, and South Asia—regions with historical malaria
burdens—while it is rare in areas where malaria was absent. Other hemoglobin variants, such
as thalassemias, show similar distributions, suggesting that malaria has been a major
selective force on human blood genes. The distribution is not determined by “race” in any
biological essence; it is shaped by ecological history and mosquito habitat.

Medical consequences follow from these evolutionary facts. Trait carriers are usually
healthy, but they can face risks in extreme conditions such as severe dehydration or very
low oxygen environments, where sickling can be triggered. People with sickle cell disease
require specialized care, including pain management and infection prevention. Meanwhile,
malaria control—bed nets, insecticides, and antimalarial drugs—changes the selective
landscape. If malaria incidence falls, the trait’s advantage diminishes, and over many
generations allele frequencies could shift. [C] Evolution does not stop; it responds to new
environments, including environments altered by public health.

Sickle cell and malaria thus illustrate how a single mutation can sit at the intersection of
molecular biology, ecology, and human history. [D] The red blood cell is both a vehicle for
oxygen and a battleground. In that battleground, a mutation that damages the cell in one
context can, in another context, make the cell a less hospitable home for a deadly parasite,
reshaping survival at the scale of populations.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: People who inherit two copies of the allele (one from each parent) often develop sickle cell disease, a serious condition in which red blood cells become misshapen, block small vessels, and break down prematurely.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across parasite
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to allele and cells
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of parasite

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys malaria but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed cells first, with allele serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats parasite as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   B. The passage presents cells as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once allele is observed, competing explanations for malaria collapse. It treats parasite as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, for the main claim of the text.
   C. The passage concedes that allele is often incomplete and concludes that malaria cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since parasite overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of cells with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   D. The passage explains malaria by linking allele to cells, and it shows why parasite changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how malaria should change if parasite is altered, instead of assuming that allele has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to cells must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in parasite, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of allele is enough to validate cells for malaria.
   C. The passage implies that parasite mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes allele effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of cells no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain malaria, within the passage’s scope.
   D. The passage treats allele primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over cells are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about malaria are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, especially regarding cells, for the main claim of the text.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of epigenetic imprinting as a factor influencing allele
   B. discussion of malaria as a factor influencing allele
   C. discussion of cells as a factor influencing allele
   D. discussion of parasite as a factor influencing allele, especially regarding allele.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: People who inherit two copies of the allele (one from each parent) often develop sickle cell disease, a serious condition in which red blood cells become misshapen, block small vessels, and break down prematurely.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, given the evidence cited, especially regarding blood.
   B. People who inherit two copies of the allele (one from each parent) often develop sickle cell disease. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, for the main claim of the text.
   D. People who inherit two copies of the allele (one from each parent) often develop sickle cell disease. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of cells guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in parasite are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because once allele fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and parasite can be ignored without changing conclusions about malaria.
   C. Because allele directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding malaria.
   D. Because comparability prevents cells from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold parasite constant while examining allele.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | allele | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | parasite | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It proves cells is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that malaria should be read alongside parasite, because allele alone does not settle what cells means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This dynamic also explains geographic patterns.
   A. the preceding claim that malaria functions as a direct measurement of cells
   B. the preceding claim that parasite alone explains the outcome of malaria
   C. the preceding claim about how allele is interpreted in relation to cells
   D. the preceding claim that allele is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses cells, so debate over allele is unnecessary noise, for the main claim of the text.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of allele lead to different conclusions about malaria.
   C. to show that the term malaria belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of allele and cells should be abandoned altogether.
