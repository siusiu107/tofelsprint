Passage 0039: Sickle-Cell Trait, Malaria, and Why Harmful Alleles Can Persist (Medicine)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 666)

In regions where malaria is common, a genetic variant that would otherwise be harmful can
persist at surprisingly high frequency. The variant is the sickle-cell allele, a change in
the gene that encodes part of hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood
cells. People who inherit two copies of the allele (one from each parent) often develop
sickle cell disease, a serious condition in which red blood cells become misshapen, block
small vessels, and break down prematurely. Yet people who inherit only one copy—carrying the
trait—often show increased resistance to severe malaria. The pattern is a classic case of
balancing selection, in which a disadvantage in one genetic state is offset by an advantage
in another.

Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted by mosquitoes, spends part of its life
cycle inside red blood cells. After invading, the parasite digests hemoglobin and
replicates, eventually causing the cell to rupture and release new parasites. Severe disease
is not only about parasite numbers; it is also about how infected cells interact with blood
vessels. Some parasites induce infected red cells to stick to vessel walls, avoiding
clearance by the spleen but creating blockages that can damage organs. [A] Survival
therefore depends on both parasite biology and the host’s blood-cell properties.

In sickle-cell trait carriers, several mechanisms can reduce the parasite’s success. One
involves oxygen tension. In low oxygen conditions, trait carriers’ red cells are more likely
to assume a partial sickle shape. Even a slight deformation can trigger changes that mark
the cell for removal by the spleen. If an infected cell is cleared earlier, the parasite has
less time to replicate. Another mechanism involves the internal chemistry of the cell. The
altered hemoglobin can promote oxidative stress, creating an environment that is hostile to
parasite growth. Additionally, infected trait cells may display parasite proteins
differently on their surfaces, reducing the ability of infected cells to adhere to vessel
walls. These effects are modest individually, but together they can shift the odds away from
severe outcomes.

The evolutionary arithmetic is ruthless. In a high-malaria environment, the risk of death
from malaria in early childhood can be substantial. If carrying one sickle-cell allele
reduces that risk even slightly, carriers may leave more descendants, increasing the
allele’s frequency. But if the allele becomes too common, more children inherit two copies
and suffer sickle cell disease, which reduces survival and reproduction. [B] The population
can reach an equilibrium where the allele persists because the trait’s protection offsets
the disease’s cost.

This dynamic also explains geographic patterns. The sickle-cell allele is common in parts of
sub‑Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean, and South Asia—regions with historical malaria
burdens—while it is rare in areas where malaria was absent. Other hemoglobin variants, such
as thalassemias, show similar distributions, suggesting that malaria has been a major
selective force on human blood genes. The distribution is not determined by “race” in any
biological essence; it is shaped by ecological history and mosquito habitat.

Medical consequences follow from these evolutionary facts. Trait carriers are usually
healthy, but they can face risks in extreme conditions such as severe dehydration or very
low oxygen environments, where sickling can be triggered. People with sickle cell disease
require specialized care, including pain management and infection prevention. Meanwhile,
malaria control—bed nets, insecticides, and antimalarial drugs—changes the selective
landscape. If malaria incidence falls, the trait’s advantage diminishes, and over many
generations allele frequencies could shift. [C] Evolution does not stop; it responds to new
environments, including environments altered by public health.

Sickle cell and malaria thus illustrate how a single mutation can sit at the intersection of
molecular biology, ecology, and human history. [D] The red blood cell is both a vehicle for
oxygen and a battleground. In that battleground, a mutation that damages the cell in one
context can, in another context, make the cell a less hospitable home for a deadly parasite,
reshaping survival at the scale of populations.

   B. a sudden epidemic
   C. a laboratory technique
   D. a mosquito breeding site

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: A host advantage need not be absolute; it only has to change the probabilities of survival and reproduction.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why multiple small mechanisms in trait carriers can matter evolutionarily?
   A. Even modest reductions in severe malaria can increase survival enough to affect allele frequencies over generations
   B. Only complete immunity can influence evolution
   C. Small effects cancel out automatically
   D. Parasites cannot adapt to host differences

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are described as ways trait status can hinder Plasmodium EXCEPT:
   A. earlier spleen clearance of deformed cells
   B. a more hostile oxidative environment
   C. reduced adhesion of infected cells to vessels
   D. increased conversion of carbon dioxide into oxygen

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss malaria control measures like bed nets and drugs?
   A. To show that changing malaria incidence can change the selective advantage of the trait over time
   B. To argue that public health cannot influence evolution
   C. To suggest that sickle cell disease is cured by nets
   D. To claim that mosquitoes transmit hemoglobin genes

7. [Reference] In the passage, “this dynamic” refers to:
   A. the balance between trait advantage against malaria and disease cost when two alleles are inherited
   B. the life cycle of mosquitoes in ponds
   C. the process of oxygen transport in lungs
   D. the spread of printing in Europe

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces the allele and disease, explains malaria’s interaction with red cells, describes protective mechanisms in trait carriers, then explains population-level balancing selection and modern implications
   B. It lists genetic terms without context
   C. It focuses only on mosquito ecology and not humans
   D. It argues that geography is unrelated to genetics

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that the allele’s distribution reflects “ecological history”?
   A. Where malaria pressure existed historically, selection favored certain blood variants, shaping regional frequencies
   B. Genes spread only by random drift and never by environment
   C. The allele appears only in one ethnic group regardless of location
   D. Mosquitoes create mutations directly in adult blood cells

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The sickle-cell allele survives because it is beneficial in all genetic forms.
   B. The passage explains that although two sickle-cell alleles cause severe disease, one allele can reduce severe malaria by altering red-cell conditions and parasite behavior, producing balancing selection that shapes geographic patterns and interacts with modern malaria control efforts.
   C. Malaria has no effect on human evolution because parasites live only in mosquitoes.
   D. Public health efforts increase the advantage of the trait by making malaria more common.
