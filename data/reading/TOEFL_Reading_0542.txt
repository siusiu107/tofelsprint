Passage 0542: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 768)

When archival records are combined, the analysis suggests researchers have treated shifts in
industrial labor demand as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. Despite the fact that oral history synthesis can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify housing covenants and
policy constraints, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive
rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which oral history synthesis constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn,
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. To be sure, a
single case can be dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, african american internal
migration is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Despite the fact that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
housing covenants and policy constraints can shift baselines, altering whether shifts in
industrial labor demand is even comparable across cases, a move that means that a good fit
is not the same as a good explanation. If housing covenants and policy constraints is
changed while the nominal driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when
conditions are perturbed.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. [A] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions
instead of treating them as afterthoughts. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—shifts in industrial labor demand—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] This reasoning matters because
it changes what counts as a decisive test. Whereas popular summaries treat shifts in
industrial labor demand as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting
point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. [C] The argument
hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation. [D] At first glance, the
pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. In this sense, south-to-
north population movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on housing covenants and policy
constraints, the interpretation shifts, and many early studies framed the great migration
and northern urban transformation as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies
emphasized shifts in industrial labor demand as a signature may be convenient, later work
asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ is
scientifically revealing. this shift mattered for how evidence from Philadelphia was
generalized because, as the author notes, local conditions can change which processes
generate shifts in industrial labor demand.

Rarely has it been the case that claims about the great migration and northern urban
transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions, at least before analysts began combining oral history synthesis with cross-site
comparisons. the goal was to break degeneracies in which shifts in industrial labor demand
could be explained in more than one way because confounders like housing covenants and
policy constraints often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts to
admit that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, twentieth-
century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about the great
migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. To be sure, the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, yet the result is a
framework in which shifts in industrial labor demand is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. housing covenants and policy constraints alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. shifts in industrial labor demand specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. census microdata analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In other words, the disagreement is not about whether the data exist, but about what the data are evidence for.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'mass relocation from the Jim Crow South' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   B. The passage implies that Chicago is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The passage treats political realignment patterns as a confounder and racial violence and intimidation as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where census microdata analysis constrains racial violence and intimidation

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | labor market inference from wage series | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | segregation and redlining signatures | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | push–pull dynamics | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Depends on modeling priors
   B. It proves political realignment patterns is unique.
   C. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   D. It makes racial violence and intimidation irrelevant.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **plausible** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.
   A. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   B. reasonable
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like labor market inference from wage series are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because housing covenants and policy constraints dominates all evidence

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because segregation and redlining signatures uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates wartime industry demand.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Detroit and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on newspaper archive research simple.

7. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if labor market inference from wage series produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. it prevents shifts in industrial labor demand from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control push–pull dynamics
   C. Since shifts in industrial labor demand is observed in Harlem, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because shifts in industrial labor demand appears, the mechanism must be unique, so push–pull dynamics can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

8. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when racial violence and intimidation can mimic changes in neighborhood composition.
   B. The author treats Chicago as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   C. The passage suggests that changes in neighborhood composition is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using housing record reconstruction.

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like racial violence and intimidation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting newspaper archive research as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that changes in neighborhood composition is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how racial violence and intimidation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Harlem. Finally, it maintains that tests combining newspaper archive research with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats newspaper archive research as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in neighborhood composition or racial violence and intimidation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that racial violence and intimidation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using newspaper archive research are unnecessary.

10. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   B. changes in neighborhood composition
   C. census microdata analysis
   D. a list of Olympic medal counts
