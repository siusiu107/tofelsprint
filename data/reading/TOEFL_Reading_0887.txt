Passage 0887: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 757)

In comparative migration studies, one sees why researchers have treated shifts in industrial
labor demand as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban transformation.
While it is true that oral history synthesis can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely
on familiar narratives.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration
and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by what competing models would
also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation is granted, then the
same observation—shifts in industrial labor demand—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat shifts in industrial
labor demand as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication.
In this sense, african american internal migration is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on push–pull dynamics, the argument
reframes the issue so that many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban
transformation as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized shifts in
industrial labor demand as a signature, later work asked whether the same signature survives
when protocols and baselines differ. The passage argues that this shift mattered for how
evidence from Detroit was generalized because local conditions can change which processes
generate shifts in industrial labor demand.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify push–pull dynamics was it
defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. [A] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence. by
comparing cases in which oral history synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could
ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author implies that
replication is informative only when protocols are comparable. Granted that a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. [C] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. [D] The author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-
chosen case. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only by analysts began combining oral history synthesis with cross-site comparisons was the
field forced to accept that claims about the great migration and northern urban
transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which shifts in industrial labor demand
could be explained in more than one way because confounders like push–pull dynamics often
co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable.

the first model can fit one dataset extremely well; still, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how push–pull
dynamics can shift baselines, altering whether shifts in industrial labor demand is even
comparable across cases, which forces analysts to admit that means that a good fit is not
the same as a good explanation. If push–pull dynamics is changed while the nominal driver
remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In
this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban
transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without
implying that any story is arbitrary. Admittedly, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a
definitive answer is strong; nevertheless, the result is a framework in which shifts in
industrial labor demand is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats census microdata analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss segregation and redlining signatures or wartime industry demand. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because segregation and redlining signatures uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that wartime industry demand is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using census microdata analysis are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that segregation and redlining signatures is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how wartime industry demand can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Philadelphia. Finally, it maintains that tests combining census microdata analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   D. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like wartime industry demand make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting census microdata analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | newspaper archive research | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | changes in neighborhood composition | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | push–pull dynamics | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices
   B. It makes push–pull dynamics irrelevant.
   C. Depends on modeling priors
   D. It proves shifts in industrial labor demand is unique.

3. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if oral history synthesis produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. Since segregation and redlining signatures is observed in Philadelphia, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. it prevents segregation and redlining signatures from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control push–pull dynamics
   D. Because push–pull dynamics co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

   A. The passage implies that Harlem is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'twentieth-century Black migration flows' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   C. The author argues that newspaper archive research should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where newspaper archive research constrains housing covenants and policy constraints

8. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving census microdata analysis.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when housing covenants and policy constraints can mimic shifts in industrial labor demand.
   C. The author treats Chicago as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   D. The passage suggests that shifts in industrial labor demand is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
