Passage 0333: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 799)

When archival records are combined, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated political realignment patterns as the decisive sign of the great
migration and northern urban transformation. Though oral history synthesis can make the
pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Not until the field adopted tests that
manipulate or stratify wartime industry demand did the debate became empirically productive
rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which oral history synthesis constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, a move that is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. To be sure, a single
case can be dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. In this sense, african american internal migration
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Only after analysts
began combining oral history synthesis with cross-site comparisons did claims about the
great migration and northern urban transformation stopped relying on a single figure and
started relying on falsifiable predictions. [A] The author uses the detour to show why a
different metric would lead to a different conclusion. the goal was to break degeneracies in
which political realignment patterns could be explained in more than one way because, as the
author notes, confounders like wartime industry demand often co-vary with the driver. [B]
This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, which changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. [C] This point forces
the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline. [D] The passage frames
uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment. If anything is
responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage presents as the lesson
of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—political realignment patterns—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries
treat political realignment patterns as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats
it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary
conditions to be stated. Only through analysts began combining oral history synthesis with
cross-site comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about the great migration and
northern urban transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which political realignment
patterns could be explained in more than one way because confounders like wartime industry
demand often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became
an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit that
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, south-to-north
population movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
Using oral history synthesis under stable conditions, the passage suggests one frequently
cited case from Detroit appeared to support the direct-readout view. Admittedly, the
original fit looked visually decisive; nevertheless, later, however, reanalysis showed that
small shifts in wartime industry demand altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic
political realignment patterns. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which is
precisely why illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. Working with sparse records and limited controls on wartime industry demand, the
passage suggests many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban
transformation as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized political
realignment patterns as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under
replication. this shift mattered for how evidence from Detroit was generalized largely
because local conditions can change which processes generate political realignment patterns.
In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, the analysis suggests the passage
concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing
assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern
urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without
implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that changes in neighborhood composition is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how housing covenants and policy constraints can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Chicago. Finally, it maintains that tests combining labor market inference from wage series with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   B. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like housing covenants and policy constraints make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting labor market inference from wage series as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that housing covenants and policy constraints is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using labor market inference from wage series are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats labor market inference from wage series as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in neighborhood composition or housing covenants and policy constraints. It ends without any methodological implication.

2. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if housing record reconstruction produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. it prevents changes in neighborhood composition from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control housing covenants and policy constraints
   C. Because changes in neighborhood composition appears, the mechanism must be unique, so housing covenants and policy constraints can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. Since changes in neighborhood composition is observed in Detroit, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The author argues that census microdata analysis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where census microdata analysis constrains wartime industry demand
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'African American internal migration' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   D. The passage treats changes in neighborhood composition as a confounder and wartime industry demand as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
