Passage 0060: Consensus Protocols and Why Replicated Logs Need Majorities and Terms (Computer Science)
======================================================================================================
(Word count: 633)

A modern application rarely runs on a single machine. Databases replicate across servers;
web services scale horizontally; and critical state—who paid, who reserved a seat, which
sensor reading is accepted—must remain consistent even when hardware fails. The difficulty
is that distributed systems do not fail politely. A machine can pause, a network link can
drop packets, and a rack can lose power, leaving different computers with different views of
“what happened.” Achieving consensus—agreement on a sequence of events—therefore becomes a
central problem in building reliable services.

One intuition is to appoint a leader. If one node is responsible for ordering commands,
followers can apply that order and remain consistent. Leader-based consensus protocols make
this intuition precise by combining three ideas: an elected leader, a replicated log of
commands, and rules for when an entry is considered committed. The leader receives client
requests, appends them to its log, and sends the new entries to followers. Followers
acknowledge receipt. Once an entry is stored on a majority of nodes, it is considered
committed and can be applied to the state machine. [A] Majority commitment matters because
it ensures that any future majority will overlap with the committed majority, preserving the
entry even if leadership changes.

Elections, however, are tricky under unreliable communication. If a leader becomes
unreachable, followers must decide whether it has failed or is merely slow. Because waiting
forever is not an option, nodes use timeouts: if a follower does not hear from a leader
within a randomized interval, it becomes a candidate and asks others to vote. Randomization
reduces the chance that multiple candidates start simultaneously, which would split votes.
Yet split votes still happen, especially in networks with variable delays. In that case, the
system may have to retry elections until one candidate gathers a majority.

Log replication raises its own hazards. Suppose a leader appends an entry and sends it to
some followers, then crashes before the entry is committed. A new leader may be elected that
does not contain the uncommitted entry. If the old leader later returns, the system must
prevent it from overwriting committed history. Protocols handle this by attaching terms
(logical epochs) to entries and by requiring leaders to prove they are up to date. [B]
Followers reject leaders whose logs are missing committed entries, and leaders overwrite
conflicting uncommitted entries so that logs converge on the same prefix.

From a distance, these rules can look like bureaucracy, yet they encode a physical truth:
networks create partial knowledge. A client might receive a “success” response from a leader
that then crashes before replication completes, creating a mismatch between the client’s
belief and the cluster’s durable state. Well-designed systems therefore distinguish between
acceptance and commitment and structure client responses accordingly. Some systems wait to
respond until commitment; others respond early but provide mechanisms to reconcile later.
The choice is a trade-off among latency, throughput, and the cost of reconciliation.

Even when consensus is correct, performance can be surprising. A majority requirement means
that if two nodes are down in a five-node cluster, progress can halt. Moreover, slow disks
can bottleneck the leader, because replication is ultimately an I/O problem. Engineers
mitigate these limits with batching, pipelining, and snapshotting: periodically compacting
the log into a state snapshot so new nodes do not replay years of history. Yet snapshots
must be coordinated with the log so that the same state is reconstructed everywhere.

Consensus protocols are sometimes described as “making many machines behave like one.” [C]
More precisely, they make many machines agree on a narrative of events, even when the world
provides contradictory fragments. [D] The achievement is not that failures disappear, but
that, through careful rules about majorities, terms, and commitment, disagreement is forced
to shrink until one history remains.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: A machine can pause, a network link can drop packets, and a rack can lose power, leaving different computers with different views of “what happened.” Achieving consensus—agreement on a sequence of events—therefore becomes a central problem in building reliable services.
   A. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of committed
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across committed
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to followers and entry

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents entry as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once followers is observed, competing explanations for leader collapse. It treats committed as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, as the discussion implies.
   B. The passage surveys leader but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed entry first, with followers serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats committed as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   C. The passage explains leader by linking followers to entry, and it shows why committed changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage concedes that followers is often incomplete and concludes that leader cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since committed overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of entry with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage treats followers primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over entry are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about leader are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in committed, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of followers is enough to validate entry for leader, in the cases described, especially regarding state.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how leader should change if committed is altered, instead of assuming that followers has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to entry must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage implies that committed mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes followers effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of entry no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain leader, given the evidence cited.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of allometric scaling as a factor influencing followers
   B. discussion of entry as a factor influencing followers, especially regarding state.
   C. discussion of leader as a factor influencing followers
   D. discussion of committed as a factor influencing followers

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: A machine can pause, a network link can drop packets, and a rack can lose power, leaving different computers with different views of “what happened.” Achieving consensus—agreement on a sequence of events—therefore becomes a central problem in building reliable services.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   C. A machine can pause. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. A machine can pause. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents entry from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold committed constant while examining followers.
   B. Because the presence of entry guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in committed are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because followers directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding leader.
   D. Because once followers fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and committed can be ignored without changing conclusions about leader.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | followers | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | committed | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It proves entry is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that leader should be read alongside committed, because followers alone does not settle what entry means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: A modern application rarely runs on a single machine.
   A. the preceding claim that committed alone explains the outcome of leader
   B. the preceding claim that followers is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   C. the preceding claim about how followers is interpreted in relation to entry
   D. the preceding claim that leader functions as a direct measurement of entry

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of followers lead to different conclusions about leader.
   B. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of followers and entry should be abandoned altogether, in the context of the passage.
   C. to show that the term leader belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   D. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses entry, so debate over followers is unnecessary noise, especially regarding followers.
