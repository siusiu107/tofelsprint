Passage 0044: Fresco as Chemistry, Workflow, and Conservation Challenge (Art History)
=====================================================================================
(Word count: 607)

A fresco looks, to a casual visitor, like paint applied to a wall. Yet a true fresco is
closer to a chemical collaboration between pigment and plaster, one that depends on timing.
In the technique known as buon fresco (“true fresco”), an artist applies pigment suspended
in water onto fresh, wet lime plaster. As the plaster dries, it undergoes carbonation:
calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form calcium carbonate. Pigment
particles become embedded within this growing mineral matrix, which can produce
extraordinary durability.

The craft begins with preparing the wall. A rough underlayer, the arriccio, provides a
stable base and can be marked with a preliminary sketch. The final smooth layer, the
intonaco, is applied in small sections called giornate, literally “day’s work,” because the
artist must paint before the plaster sets. This constraint shapes composition. Large scenes
are planned so that seams fall along natural boundaries—an architectural edge, a fold of
fabric—so that transitions are less visible. [A] The day-by-day rhythm means that fresco is
as much scheduling as artistry: the wall’s chemistry dictates the pace of imagination.

Pigments must also be chosen with chemistry in mind. Some pigments tolerate the alkaline
environment of wet lime; others do not. Organic dyes and certain blues can degrade or shift
color. Artists therefore favored mineral pigments such as ochres for reds and yellows, green
earth for muted greens, and carbon black for deep shadows. The famous blue of some
Renaissance ceilings, made from lapis lazuli, posed a problem because ultramarine could be
altered by the plaster’s alkalinity. To preserve its brilliance, artists sometimes applied
it a secco—on dry plaster—using a binder such as egg or glue. The result could be visually
striking yet mechanically more fragile, because the pigment sat on the surface rather than
being locked into the carbonate matrix.

This difference matters to conservators. A buon fresco layer can survive centuries of
humidity swings, while a secco addition can flake when salts migrate through the wall and
crystallize near the surface. Salt crystallization exerts pressure in pores, pushing
particles apart. Similarly, water infiltration can dissolve and redeposit minerals, leaving
efflorescence—white blooms—that obscure colors. [B] Even when pigments remain intact, the
wall can change under them, as if the painting were sitting on a slowly evolving geological
substrate.

Restoration therefore requires diagnosis. Conservators may use raking light to reveal raised
cracks, microscopy to examine plaster layers, and carefully controlled cleaning to remove
soot without stripping original pigment. Decisions are ethical as well as technical. Over-
cleaning can erase a painter’s subtle shading, while under-cleaning can leave the image dull
and unreadable. Some restorations aim for visual unity; others prefer to leave losses
visible, preserving the record of damage rather than simulating wholeness. Each approach
implies a philosophy of what it means for a wall painting to “be” the artwork: the original
surface, the accumulated history, or a curated compromise.

Fresco’s constraints also influenced style. Because blending must be done quickly on wet
plaster, fresco painters often used bold forms and clear tonal zones. Fine details could be
added later a secco, but those additions risked decay. In this way, technique and aesthetics
intertwined. A fresco’s apparent simplicity can be an artifact of chemical deadlines, not of
limited imagination. [C]

Thus, a fresco is not merely pigment on stone; it is pigment becoming stone. [D] Its
endurance rests on the moment when a wet wall turns into carbonate rock and traps color
inside a crystal framework—an outcome that depends on the artist’s ability to work at the
speed of chemistry.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: A buon fresco layer can survive centuries of humidity swings, while a secco addition can flake when salts migrate through the wall and crystallize near the surface.
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of pigments
   C. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to plaster and pigment
   D. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across pigments

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys fresco but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed pigment first, with plaster serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats pigments as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   B. The passage presents pigment as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once plaster is observed, competing explanations for fresco collapse. It treats pigments as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding artist.
   C. The passage explains fresco by linking plaster to pigment, and it shows why pigments changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage concedes that plaster is often incomplete and concludes that fresco cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since pigments overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of pigment with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that pigments mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes plaster effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of pigment no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain fresco, especially regarding artist.
   B. A persuasive account would predict how fresco should change if pigments is altered, instead of assuming that plaster has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to pigment must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   C. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in pigments, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of plaster is enough to validate pigment for fresco, especially regarding applied, especially regarding pigments.
   D. The passage treats plaster primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over pigment are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about fresco are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of pigment as a factor influencing plaster
   B. discussion of pigments as a factor influencing plaster, especially regarding fresco.
   C. discussion of fresco as a factor influencing plaster
   D. discussion of radiocarbon reservoir effects as a factor influencing plaster

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: A buon fresco layer can survive centuries of humidity swings, while a secco addition can flake when salts migrate through the wall and crystallize near the surface.
   A. A buon fresco layer can survive centuries of humidity swings. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding plaster.
   C. A buon fresco layer can survive centuries of humidity swings. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once plaster fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and pigments can be ignored without changing conclusions about fresco.
   B. Because comparability prevents pigment from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold pigments constant while examining plaster.
   C. Because plaster directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding fresco.
   D. Because the presence of pigment guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in pigments are merely stylistic noise.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | plaster | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | pigments | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves pigment is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that fresco should be read alongside pigments, because plaster alone does not settle what pigment means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Pigment particles become embedded within this growing mineral matrix, which can produce extraordinary durability.
   A. the idea that The craft begins with preparing the wall, in the examples provided, given the evidence cited, as the discussion implies.
   B. the idea that In the technique known as buon fresco (“true fresco”), an artist applies pigment suspended in water onto fresh, wet lime plaster
   C. the idea that As the plaster dries, it undergoes carbonation: calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form calcium carbonate
   D. the idea that The famous blue of some Renaissance ceilings, made from lapis lazuli, posed a problem because ultramarine could be altered by the plaster’s alkalinity...
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term fresco belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   B. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of plaster and pigment should be abandoned altogether, for the main claim of the text.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of plaster lead to different conclusions about fresco.
   D. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses pigment, so debate over plaster is unnecessary noise, especially regarding pigment.
