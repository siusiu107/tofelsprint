Passage 0044: Fresco as Chemistry, Workflow, and Conservation Challenge (Art History)
=====================================================================================
(Word count: 607)

A fresco looks, to a casual visitor, like paint applied to a wall. Yet a true fresco is
closer to a chemical collaboration between pigment and plaster, one that depends on timing.
In the technique known as buon fresco (“true fresco”), an artist applies pigment suspended
in water onto fresh, wet lime plaster. As the plaster dries, it undergoes carbonation:
calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form calcium carbonate. Pigment
particles become embedded within this growing mineral matrix, which can produce
extraordinary durability.

The craft begins with preparing the wall. A rough underlayer, the arriccio, provides a
stable base and can be marked with a preliminary sketch. The final smooth layer, the
intonaco, is applied in small sections called giornate, literally “day’s work,” because the
artist must paint before the plaster sets. This constraint shapes composition. Large scenes
are planned so that seams fall along natural boundaries—an architectural edge, a fold of
fabric—so that transitions are less visible. [A] The day-by-day rhythm means that fresco is
as much scheduling as artistry: the wall’s chemistry dictates the pace of imagination.

Pigments must also be chosen with chemistry in mind. Some pigments tolerate the alkaline
environment of wet lime; others do not. Organic dyes and certain blues can degrade or shift
color. Artists therefore favored mineral pigments such as ochres for reds and yellows, green
earth for muted greens, and carbon black for deep shadows. The famous blue of some
Renaissance ceilings, made from lapis lazuli, posed a problem because ultramarine could be
altered by the plaster’s alkalinity. To preserve its brilliance, artists sometimes applied
it a secco—on dry plaster—using a binder such as egg or glue. The result could be visually
striking yet mechanically more fragile, because the pigment sat on the surface rather than
being locked into the carbonate matrix.

This difference matters to conservators. A buon fresco layer can survive centuries of
humidity swings, while a secco addition can flake when salts migrate through the wall and
crystallize near the surface. Salt crystallization exerts pressure in pores, pushing
particles apart. Similarly, water infiltration can dissolve and redeposit minerals, leaving
efflorescence—white blooms—that obscure colors. [B] Even when pigments remain intact, the
wall can change under them, as if the painting were sitting on a slowly evolving geological
substrate.

Restoration therefore requires diagnosis. Conservators may use raking light to reveal raised
cracks, microscopy to examine plaster layers, and carefully controlled cleaning to remove
soot without stripping original pigment. Decisions are ethical as well as technical. Over-
cleaning can erase a painter’s subtle shading, while under-cleaning can leave the image dull
and unreadable. Some restorations aim for visual unity; others prefer to leave losses
visible, preserving the record of damage rather than simulating wholeness. Each approach
implies a philosophy of what it means for a wall painting to “be” the artwork: the original
surface, the accumulated history, or a curated compromise.

Fresco’s constraints also influenced style. Because blending must be done quickly on wet
plaster, fresco painters often used bold forms and clear tonal zones. Fine details could be
added later a secco, but those additions risked decay. In this way, technique and aesthetics
intertwined. A fresco’s apparent simplicity can be an artifact of chemical deadlines, not of
limited imagination. [C]

Thus, a fresco is not merely pigment on stone; it is pigment becoming stone. [D] Its
endurance rests on the moment when a wet wall turns into carbonate rock and traps color
inside a crystal framework—an outcome that depends on the artist’s ability to work at the
speed of chemistry.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, what chemical process helps make buon fresco durable?
   A. carbonation that forms calcium conservators and embeds pigment in the plaster matrix. This outcome would hold even if artists stays constant.
   B. carbonation that forms calcium carbonate and embeds pigment in the plaster matrix. This would occur only when challenge dominates.
   C. carbonation that forms calcium carbonate and embeds pigment in the plaster matrix. This would require challenge to be the limiting factor.
   D. carbonation that forms calcium carbonate and embeds pigment in the plaster matrix.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “giornate” in the passage most nearly refers to:
   A. salts that crystallize on wall surfaces
   B. sections of fresh plaster intended to be painted in a
   C. a mineral used to create ultramarine blue
   D. a cleaning technique using raking light


3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Once the surface loses its wet sheen, pigment can no longer merge into the setting layer in the same way.
   A. [B]
   B. [C]
   C. [D]
   D. [A]


4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why a secco additions are often more fragile than buon fresco layers?
   A. They rely on binders on a dry surface rather than being incorporated into the carbonate matrix. This would require technique to be the limiting factor.
   B. They rely on binders on a dry surface rather than being incorporated into the carbonate matrix.
   C. They rely on binders on a dry surface rather than being incorporated into the large matrix. This would require technique to be the limiting factor.
   D. They rely on binders on a dry surface rather than being incorporated into the carbonate matrix. This would require conservation to be the limiting factor.


5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss salt crystallization and efflorescence?
   A. To show how physical and chemical changes in walls can damage or obscure fresco surfaces over time.
   B. To show how physical and chemical changes in walls must damage or obscure fresco surfaces over time. That would make pigment the primary constraint.
   C. To show how physical and chemical changes in walls can solely damage or obscure fresco surfaces over time. This would occur only when artists dominates.
   D. To show how physical and chemical changes in walls can damage or obscure history surfaces over time. This would require chemistry to be the limiting factor.

   A. GPS receivers tracking plate motion.

7. [Reference] In the passage, “this difference” refers to the distinction between:
   A. pigment embedded by buon fresco versus pigment applied on dry plaster a secco. That would make conservation the primary constraint.

   D. It explains the chemistry and workflow of buon fresco, contrasts it with a secco additions, then connects material differences to conservation challenges and stylistic consequences. That would make fresco the primary constraint.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates “fresco is as much scheduling as artistry”?
   A. even though plaster sets on a chemical timetable, painters must plan composition and work pace around drying. This would occur only when fresco dominates.
