Passage 0898: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 620)

Under expanded parameter sweeps, the passage argues that researchers have treated structure-
sensitive activity as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
Though DFT surface modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues
that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify support
interactions. [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
by comparing cases in which DFT surface modeling constrains alternatives, researchers could
ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author treats this as a clue
rather than as a nuisance. Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny
the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] Later
comparisons reveal why this matters. [D] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the
author frames it as conditional. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on support interactions, the interpretation
shifts, and many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces as a
single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized structure-sensitive activity
as a signature, later work asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and
baselines differ. The passage argues that this shift mattered for how evidence from
laboratory single-crystal studies was generalized because local conditions can change which
processes generate structure-sensitive activity.

Only through analysts began combining DFT surface modeling with cross-site comparisons could
one reasonably claim that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which structure-sensitive activity could be explained in more than one
way because confounders like support interactions often co-vary with the driver, which is
why replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Even though the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how support
interactions can shift baselines, altering whether structure-sensitive activity is even
comparable across cases; this, in turn, means that a good fit is not the same as a good
explanation. If support interactions is changed while the nominal driver remains constant, a
different prediction follows: one should expect different outcomes when conditions are
perturbed. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; still, the result is a
framework in which structure-sensitive activity is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using temperature-programmed desorption.
   B. The passage suggests that rate enhancement is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when support interactions can mimic rate enhancement.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving temperature-programmed desorption.

2. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that model assumptions is important mainly because:
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if temperature-programmed desorption produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once rate enhancement is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. The passage implies that temperature-programmed desorption directly measures causes, meaning confounding from facet dependence is impossible.
   D. it prevents rate enhancement from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control facet dependence

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where in situ spectroscopy constrains catalyst deactivation
   B. The author argues that in situ spectroscopy should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   D. The passage treats rate enhancement as a confounder and catalyst deactivation as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. facet dependence alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. microkinetic modeling as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. rate enhancement specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

5. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. poisoning by CO
   B. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   C. a recipe for bread fermentation
   D. surface microscopy

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats temperature-programmed desorption as a historical curiosity and does not discuss poisoning by CO or support interactions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because poisoning by CO uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that support interactions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using temperature-programmed desorption are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like support interactions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting temperature-programmed desorption as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that poisoning by CO is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how support interactions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from industrial hydrogenation reactors. Finally, it maintains that tests combining temperature-programmed desorption with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conspicuous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Working with sparse records and limited controls on support interactions, the interpretation shifts, and many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces as a single-mechanism phenomenon.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because support interactions dominates all evidence
   B. easy to notice
   C. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like in situ spectroscopy are needed

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because rate enhancement uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates facet dependence.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in industrial hydrogenation reactors and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on microkinetic modeling simple.
