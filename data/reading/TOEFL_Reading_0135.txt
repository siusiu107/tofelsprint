Passage 0135: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 753)

In cross-site comparisons, researchers have treated changes in reef fish assemblages as the
decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves. photophysiology measurements
can make the pattern look unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is
conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about
data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit
that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Despite the fact that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
symbiont clade switching can shift baselines, altering whether changes in reef fish
assemblages is even comparable across cases, which means that a good fit is not the same as
a good explanation. If symbiont clade switching is changed while the nominal driver remains
constant is granted, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In
this sense, thermal bleaching events is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify symbiont clade switching did
the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases
in which photophysiology measurements constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. To be sure, a single case can be
dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on symbiont clade switching, it is
difficult to deny that many early studies framed coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized changes in reef
fish assemblages as a signature, later work asked whether the same signature survives when
protocols and baselines differ. this shift mattered for how evidence from the Great Barrier
Reef was generalized in part because local conditions can change which processes generate
changes in reef fish assemblages. In this sense, loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat
stress is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move
from description to explanation, then the same observation—changes in reef fish
assemblages—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat changes in reef fish assemblages as an endpoint, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

Only after analysts began combining photophysiology measurements with cross-site comparisons
did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about coral bleaching
triggered by marine heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. [A] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors
to be discarded. the goal was to break degeneracies in which changes in reef fish
assemblages could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like
symbiont clade switching often co-vary with the driver. [B] At first glance, the pattern
seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. [C] The author shifts from narrative
to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. [D] The author implies that
replication is informative only when protocols are comparable. In this sense, reef-scale
bleaching episodes is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which
forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories
without implying that any story is arbitrary. the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a
definitive answer is strong; still, the result is a framework in which changes in reef fish
assemblages is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

8. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once reduced photosynthetic efficiency is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Because reduced photosynthetic efficiency appears, the mechanism must be unique, so compound stressors such as acidification and pollution can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. it prevents reduced photosynthetic efficiency from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control compound stressors such as acidification and pollution
   D. The passage implies that reef-scale temperature loggers directly measures causes, meaning confounding from compound stressors such as acidification and pollution is impossible.

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that reduced photosynthetic efficiency is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how shading and cooling refugia can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Caribbean reef tracts. Finally, it maintains that tests combining reef-scale temperature loggers with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   B. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like shading and cooling refugia make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting reef-scale temperature loggers as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because reduced photosynthetic efficiency uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that shading and cooling refugia is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using reef-scale temperature loggers are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats reef-scale temperature loggers as a historical curiosity and does not discuss reduced photosynthetic efficiency or shading and cooling refugia. It ends without any methodological implication.

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **convergent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:

   A. complete and final, so no further checks like satellite thermal stress maps are needed
   B. irrelevant to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves, serving only as background detail
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because shading and cooling refugia dominates all evidence
   D. coming together
