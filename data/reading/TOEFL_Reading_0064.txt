Passage 0064: Three-Way Catalysts and How Cars Convert NOx, CO, and Hydrocarbons (Chemistry/Engineering)
========================================================================================================
(Word count: 601)

When gasoline engines burn fuel, the ideal products are carbon dioxide and water. In
reality, combustion is imperfect. At high temperatures, nitrogen in the air can form
nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), collectively called NOx. If the mixture is rich, some fuel
escapes as carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC). Because these pollutants
contribute to smog and harm health, modern vehicles rely on catalytic converters to
transform them before they leave the tailpipe.

The most common design for gasoline cars is the three-way catalyst, so named because it
simultaneously oxidizes CO, oxidizes hydrocarbons, and reduces NOx. Achieving all three
requires careful chemistry and careful control of the air–fuel ratio. Platinum and palladium
sites promote oxidation reactions, converting CO to CO2 and hydrocarbons to CO2 and H2O.
Rhodium is particularly effective for reducing NOx, stripping oxygen and releasing nitrogen
as N2. [A] The converter works best when the exhaust is near stoichiometric—neither strongly
oxygen-rich nor strongly oxygen-poor—because oxidation requires oxygen while NOx reduction
is hindered by excess oxygen.

To stabilize performance, catalysts use an oxygen-storage component, commonly cerium oxide
(ceria) often mixed with zirconia. Ceria can store oxygen when the exhaust is oxygen-rich
and release it when the exhaust turns oxygen-poor, buffering rapid fluctuations caused by
engine control. In effect, the catalyst does not merely provide reactive surfaces; it also
provides a chemical reservoir that smooths the exhaust environment. Engineers exploit this
by operating engines with feedback systems that oscillate slightly around stoichiometry,
allowing the catalyst to alternately fill and empty its oxygen storage. [B] The result is a
converter that tolerates real driving, in which acceleration, deceleration, and temperature
change occur continuously.

The cold-start problem reveals the converter’s limitations. Catalysts require heat to become
active, and during the first minute or two after an engine starts, the converter may be too
cool for rapid reactions. Unfortunately, this is also when emissions are high, because fuel
mixtures are often richer and combustion less stable. Manufacturers therefore place
catalysts closer to the engine, insulate exhaust paths, or use electrically heated catalysts
to bring the active surface to operating temperature faster.

Deactivation remains a persistent challenge. Sulfur compounds in fuel can adsorb to
catalytic sites, “poisoning” them and reducing activity, although high temperatures can
sometimes reverse this. Lead, once used in gasoline, permanently poisoned catalysts, which
is why unleaded fuel became essential for widespread converter adoption. Thermal sintering
can also reduce activity: at very high temperatures, tiny metal particles can agglomerate
into larger ones, lowering surface area. Meanwhile, the ceramic washcoat that holds the
precious metals can crack or detach under vibration and thermal cycling.

Despite these vulnerabilities, catalytic converters are a striking example of practical
chemistry. They translate abstract concepts—adsorption, surface reactions, redox
balance—into a device that quietly changes urban air. [C] They also illustrate an
engineering truth: performance emerges from the interaction between materials and control.
[D] A converter is not simply “a catalyst,” but a system that includes sensors, fuel
injection strategies, and a chemical buffer that, together, turn messy combustion into
cleaner exhaust.

Because cold starts dominate urban emissions, researchers test catalysts in transient cycles
rather than in steady, idealized flows.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, why is the three-way catalyst most effective near a stoichiometric air–fuel ratio?
   A. Because oxidation needs oxygen while NOx reduction is inhibited by too much oxygen, so balance allows both to proceed
   B. Because stoichiometric mixtures prevent any NOx from forming in the engine
   C. Because precious metals dissolve unless oxygen is absent
   D. Because ceria can store fuel molecules only at stoichiometry

2. [Vocabulary] The word “buffering” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. reducing the impact of rapid fluctuations by absorbing and releasing oxygen
   B. amplifying changes in exhaust composition
   C. physically filtering soot particles only
   D. measuring exhaust temperature with a sensor

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why placing a catalyst closer to the engine helps during cold starts?

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention leaded gasoline in a discussion of catalytic converters?
   A. To illustrate how a specific contaminant can permanently poison catalysts and thus shaped fuel standards
   B. To argue that lead improves catalyst efficiency when used correctly
   C. To explain why NOx forms in the atmosphere

   D. the time when lead permanently poisons the catalyst

   D. It compares catalytic converters with ocean mixing in detail

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that the converter is “a system”?

   B. A converter works independently and does not interact with engine operation
   C. The system refers only to the ceramic casing shape
   D. Converters rely on plant-like metabolic pathways to store oxygen

   A. Catalytic converters work only by filtering particles and do not change gas chemistry.
   B.
