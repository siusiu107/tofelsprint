Passage 0064: Three-Way Catalysts and How Cars Convert NOx, CO, and Hydrocarbons (Chemistry/Engineering)
========================================================================================================
(Word count: 601)

When gasoline engines burn fuel, the ideal products are carbon dioxide and water. In
reality, combustion is imperfect. At high temperatures, nitrogen in the air can form
nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), collectively called NOx. If the mixture is rich, some fuel
escapes as carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC). Because these pollutants
contribute to smog and harm health, modern vehicles rely on catalytic converters to
transform them before they leave the tailpipe.

The most common design for gasoline cars is the three-way catalyst, so named because it
simultaneously oxidizes CO, oxidizes hydrocarbons, and reduces NOx. Achieving all three
requires careful chemistry and careful control of the air–fuel ratio. Platinum and palladium
sites promote oxidation reactions, converting CO to CO2 and hydrocarbons to CO2 and H2O.
Rhodium is particularly effective for reducing NOx, stripping oxygen and releasing nitrogen
as N2. [A] The converter works best when the exhaust is near stoichiometric—neither strongly
oxygen-rich nor strongly oxygen-poor—because oxidation requires oxygen while NOx reduction
is hindered by excess oxygen.

To stabilize performance, catalysts use an oxygen-storage component, commonly cerium oxide
(ceria) often mixed with zirconia. Ceria can store oxygen when the exhaust is oxygen-rich
and release it when the exhaust turns oxygen-poor, buffering rapid fluctuations caused by
engine control. In effect, the catalyst does not merely provide reactive surfaces; it also
provides a chemical reservoir that smooths the exhaust environment. Engineers exploit this
by operating engines with feedback systems that oscillate slightly around stoichiometry,
allowing the catalyst to alternately fill and empty its oxygen storage. [B] The result is a
converter that tolerates real driving, in which acceleration, deceleration, and temperature
change occur continuously.

The cold-start problem reveals the converter’s limitations. Catalysts require heat to become
active, and during the first minute or two after an engine starts, the converter may be too
cool for rapid reactions. Unfortunately, this is also when emissions are high, because fuel
mixtures are often richer and combustion less stable. Manufacturers therefore place
catalysts closer to the engine, insulate exhaust paths, or use electrically heated catalysts
to bring the active surface to operating temperature faster.

Deactivation remains a persistent challenge. Sulfur compounds in fuel can adsorb to
catalytic sites, “poisoning” them and reducing activity, although high temperatures can
sometimes reverse this. Lead, once used in gasoline, permanently poisoned catalysts, which
is why unleaded fuel became essential for widespread converter adoption. Thermal sintering
can also reduce activity: at very high temperatures, tiny metal particles can agglomerate
into larger ones, lowering surface area. Meanwhile, the ceramic washcoat that holds the
precious metals can crack or detach under vibration and thermal cycling.

Despite these vulnerabilities, catalytic converters are a striking example of practical
chemistry. They translate abstract concepts—adsorption, surface reactions, redox
balance—into a device that quietly changes urban air. [C] They also illustrate an
engineering truth: performance emerges from the interaction between materials and control.
[D] A converter is not simply “a catalyst,” but a system that includes sensors, fuel
injection strategies, and a chemical buffer that, together, turn messy combustion into
cleaner exhaust.

Because cold starts dominate urban emissions, researchers test catalysts in transient cycles
rather than in steady, idealized flows.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] A converter is not simply “a catalyst,” but a system that includes sensors, fuel injection strategies, and a chemical buffer that, together, turn messy combustion into cleaner exhaust.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to converter and exhaust
   B. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of starts
   C. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across starts
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains catalysts by linking converter to exhaust, and it shows why starts changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents exhaust as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once converter is observed, competing explanations for catalysts collapse. It treats starts as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage concedes that converter is often incomplete and concludes that catalysts cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since starts overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of exhaust with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, in the context of the passage.
   D. The passage surveys catalysts but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed exhaust first, with converter serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats starts as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage treats converter primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over exhaust are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about catalysts are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, for the phenomenon at issue.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in starts, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of converter is enough to validate exhaust for catalysts.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how catalysts should change if starts is altered, instead of assuming that converter has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to exhaust must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage implies that starts mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes converter effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of exhaust no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain catalysts, especially regarding catalysts.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of exhaust as a factor influencing converter, especially regarding exhaust.
   B. discussion of catalysts as a factor influencing converter
   C. discussion of archival bias as a factor influencing converter
   D. discussion of starts as a factor influencing converter

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] A converter is not simply “a catalyst,” but a system that includes sensors, fuel injection strategies, and a chemical buffer that, together, turn messy combustion into cleaner exhaust.
   A. [D] A converter is not simply “a catalyst. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   B. [D] A converter is not simply “a catalyst. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of exhaust guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in starts are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because converter directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding catalysts.
   C. Because comparability prevents exhaust from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold starts constant while examining converter.
   D. Because once converter fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and starts can be ignored without changing conclusions about catalysts.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | converter | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | starts | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It proves exhaust is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that catalysts should be read alongside starts, because converter alone does not settle what exhaust means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: When gasoline engines burn fuel, the ideal products are carbon dioxide and water.
   A. the preceding claim that starts alone explains the outcome of catalysts
   B. the preceding claim about how converter is interpreted in relation to exhaust
   C. the preceding claim that converter is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   D. the preceding claim that catalysts functions as a direct measurement of exhaust

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term catalysts belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of converter lead to different conclusions about catalysts.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of converter and exhaust should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses exhaust, so debate over converter is unnecessary noise, given the evidence cited, especially regarding urban.
