Passage 0668: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 723)

When adoption is measured in aggregates, the analysis suggests researchers have treated
wealth accumulation gaps as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence
of neighborhood inequality. quasi-experimental policy evaluation can make the pattern look
unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, it becomes plausible that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike post-industrial cities. [A] At first
glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. The passage
argues that the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms
differed because zoning rules and land-use regulation shifted the baseline in different
directions across sites. [B] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter
the pipeline. Not treating wealth accumulation gaps as a self-sufficient conclusion, but the
author therefore separates detection from interpretation. [C] The author treats this as a
clue rather than as a nuisance. [D] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as
a decisive test. In this sense, spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—wealth accumulation gaps—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat wealth accumulation gaps as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is
scientifically revealing.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Provided
that one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—wealth
accumulation gaps—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat wealth accumulation gaps as an endpoint in one
account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts in another. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is the apparent regularity of wealth accumulation gaps that drives the first
interpretation: wealth accumulation gaps is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. Were
wealth accumulation gaps is uniquely produced by one causal pathway to fail, then
observations from post-industrial cities would be transferable, and disagreement would be
largely technical. So the literature is full of such claims, and so, too, does the evidence
undermine the caveat that zoning rules and land-use regulation might reproduce the same
pattern.

Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify zoning rules and land-use
regulation was the field forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive
rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which quasi-experimental policy
evaluation constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, persistent
neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps
explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary. the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is
strong; still, the result is a framework in which wealth accumulation gaps is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how informational asymmetries in housing search can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from rapidly growing Sun Belt regions. Finally, it maintains that tests combining spatial autocorrelation analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   B. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like informational asymmetries in housing search make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting spatial autocorrelation analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats spatial autocorrelation analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or informational asymmetries in housing search. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that informational asymmetries in housing search is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using spatial autocorrelation analysis are unnecessary.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. a list of Olympic medal counts
   B. mobility constraints across space
   C. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   D. quasi-experimental policy evaluation

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the inference is underdetermined, the most informative tests are those that break degeneracies rather than those that merely sharpen one feature.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. wealth accumulation gaps specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. credit market discrimination alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. longitudinal panel data as a device rather than as an analytic approach

5. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that boundary conditions is important mainly because:
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once school-quality gradients is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. it prevents school-quality gradients from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control zoning rules and land-use regulation
   C. Because zoning rules and land-use regulation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. The passage implies that longitudinal panel data directly measures causes, meaning confounding from zoning rules and land-use regulation is impossible.

6. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **attenuated** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Provided that one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—wealth accumulation gaps—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. weakened
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like quasi-experimental policy evaluation are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because zoning rules and land-use regulation dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates credit market discrimination.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on audit studies in housing markets simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in post-industrial cities and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies one mechanism.

   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves disparate exposure to pollution is unique.
   B. May be muted by other processes
   C. Can introduce systematic bias
   D. It replaces quasi-experimental policy evaluation with intuition.

9. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
