Passage 0437: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 766)

In cross-site comparisons, the analysis suggests researchers have treated mortality and
phase shifts as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves. To be
sure, degree-heating-week metrics can make the pattern look unusually sharp, yet the passage
argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, an
outcome that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives. In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike the Coral Triangle. The passage argues
that the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed
because compound stressors such as acidification and pollution shifted the baseline in
different directions across sites. So the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation, and so, too, does the evidence undermine treating mortality and phase shifts
as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, thermal bleaching events is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Rarely, unless analysts began combining
degree-heating-week metrics with cross-site comparisons, does one see why claims about coral
bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which mortality
and phase shifts could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like
compound stressors such as acidification and pollution often co-vary with the driver. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. Only
after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify compound stressors such as
acidification and pollution did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which degree-heating-week metrics constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. While it is true that a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. It is methodological humility, rather than a
single headline feature, that the passage presents as the lesson of coral bleaching
triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the same
observation—mortality and phase shifts—must be paired with tests that change the conditions
under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat mortality and phase shifts as an
endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. In this sense, loss of
symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label. Only through analysts began combining degree-heating-week metrics with
cross-site comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about coral bleaching
triggered by marine heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. [A] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating
them as afterthoughts. the goal was to break degeneracies in which mortality and phase
shifts could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like compound
stressors such as acidification and pollution often co-vary with the driver. [B] The author
implies that replication is informative only when protocols are comparable. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. [C] The
discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. [D] This is why
the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred. Rarely, unless the
field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify compound stressors such as acidification and
pollution, does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which degree-heating-week metrics constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. To be sure, a single
case can be dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. In this sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, the passage
argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. Because compound stressors such as acidification and pollution co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once mortality and phase shifts is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. it prevents mortality and phase shifts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control compound stressors such as acidification and pollution
   D. Because mortality and phase shifts appears, the mechanism must be unique, so compound stressors such as acidification and pollution can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where photophysiology measurements constrains disease outbreaks
   B. The passage implies that Caribbean reef tracts is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The passage treats recruitment failure as a confounder and disease outbreaks as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The discussion suggests that disease outbreaks is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: That shift in framing changed which questions were even worth asking, since 'detection' and 'interpretation' were no longer treated as the same task.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats the Coral Triangle as a special case and argues that no broader inference about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves is possible.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving satellite thermal stress maps.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using satellite thermal stress maps.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when shading and cooling refugia can mimic recruitment failure.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like degree-heating-week metrics are needed
   B. important
   C. irrelevant to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves, serving only as background detail
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because local adaptation dominates all evidence

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: the goal was to break degeneracies in which mortality and phase shifts could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like compound stressors such as acidification and pollution often co-vary with the driver.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Red Sea reefs and everywhere else.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates disease outbreaks.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because reduced photosynthetic efficiency uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on photophysiology measurements simple.

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the length of the Nile in miles
   B. Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves
   C. shifts in carbonate accretion
   D. reef-scale temperature loggers

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like shading and cooling refugia make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting reef-scale temperature loggers as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that reduced photosynthetic efficiency is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how shading and cooling refugia can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Coral Triangle. Finally, it maintains that tests combining reef-scale temperature loggers with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats reef-scale temperature loggers as a historical curiosity and does not discuss reduced photosynthetic efficiency or shading and cooling refugia. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because reduced photosynthetic efficiency uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that shading and cooling refugia is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using reef-scale temperature loggers are unnecessary.
