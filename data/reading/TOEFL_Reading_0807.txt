Passage 0807: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 719)

In replication efforts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: researchers
have treated increased liking for chosen options as the decisive sign of cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization. To be sure, choice-induced preference
paradigms can make the pattern look unusually sharp, yet the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike political opinion panels. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because self-concept
threat shifted the baseline in different directions across sites, which is why replication
matters. The issue is not treating increased liking for chosen options as a self-sufficient
conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this
sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label.

Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which choice-induced preference paradigms constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat was the
field forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which choice-induced preference paradigms constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is
precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. To
be sure, a single case can be dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, dissonance
reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Not until analysts began combining choice-induced preference paradigms with cross-site
comparisons did claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which increased liking for chosen options could be explained in more
than one way largely because confounders like self-concept threat often co-vary with the
driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than
a stylistic choice, which changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The discussion treats
exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. Should one wishes to move from
description to explanation be true, then the same observation—increased liking for chosen
options—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The
passage highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. Whereas popular
summaries treat increased liking for chosen options as an endpoint in one account, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in
another. [C] The author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen
case. [D] The argument hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation. In this
sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even though
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which increased liking for chosen options is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if choice-induced preference paradigms produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. Because self-concept threat co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. Since shifted confidence judgments is observed in political opinion panels, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control self-concept threat

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. selective memory for supporting evidence
   B. behavioral priming designs
   C. a recipe for bread fermentation
   D. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization

3. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away measurement reactivity, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. The author treats political opinion panels as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving longitudinal attitude surveys.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when measurement reactivity can mimic increased liking for chosen options.

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like longitudinal attitude surveys are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because self-concept threat dominates all evidence
   C. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   D. unclear

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-national survey samples and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on meta-analytic synthesis simple.

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: The issue is not treating increased liking for chosen options as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation.
   A. implicit association tests as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. cultural norms about consistency alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. increased liking for chosen options specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | meta-analytic synthesis | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | increased liking for chosen options | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | public versus private commitment | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   B. Can be degenerate with another effect
   C. It proves increased liking for chosen options is unique.
   D. It makes self-concept threat irrelevant.

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting meta-analytic synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats meta-analytic synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss devaluation of rejected alternatives or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that devaluation of rejected alternatives is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-national survey samples. Finally, it maintains that tests combining meta-analytic synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using meta-analytic synthesis are unnecessary.

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This is why the author dwells on assumptions: without them, two teams can analyze the same record and still disagree honestly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains measurement reactivity
   B. The passage implies that cross-national survey samples is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author argues that implicit association tests should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'post-choice attitude change' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
