Passage 0531: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 671)

In classic laboratory tasks, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated shifted confidence judgments as the decisive sign of cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization. Granted that behavioral priming designs can
make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is
conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about
data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from
description to explanation be true, then the same observation—shifted confidence
judgments—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat shifted confidence judgments as an endpoint is easy to
measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. In this sense, post-choice attitude
change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which behavioral priming designs constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. While it is true that a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

Only by analysts began combining behavioral priming designs with cross-site comparisons was
the field forced to accept that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which shifted confidence judgments could
be explained in more than one way because confounders like cultural norms about consistency
often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in
turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, dissonance
reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on cultural norms about consistency, the
interpretation shifts, and many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] This is presented not as a loophole,
but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Whereas those studies emphasized shifted
confidence judgments as a signature invites a tidy story, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ forces boundary conditions to be
stated. [B] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as an
embarrassment. this shift mattered for how evidence from political opinion panels was
generalized because local conditions can change which processes generate shifted confidence
judgments, which is why replication matters. [C] The argument hinges on what would change
under an alternative explanation. [D] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Even though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result
is a framework in which shifted confidence judgments is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. longitudinal attitude surveys as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. self-concept threat alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. shifted confidence judgments specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **persistent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like implicit association tests are needed
   B. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   C. lasting
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal attitude surveys with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal attitude surveys as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal attitude surveys are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal attitude surveys as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This is why the author dwells on assumptions: without them, two teams can analyze the same record and still disagree honestly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on behavioral priming designs simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates public versus private commitment.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The passage treats shifted confidence judgments as a confounder and measurement reactivity as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The passage implies that cross-national survey samples is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal attitude surveys constrains measurement reactivity
   D. The author argues that longitudinal attitude surveys should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. meta-analytic synthesis
   B. devaluation of rejected alternatives
   C. the price of coal in 1700
   D. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization

8. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away measurement reactivity, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when measurement reactivity can mimic selective memory for supporting evidence.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving implicit association tests.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using implicit association tests.

9. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | choice-induced preference paradigms | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | shifted confidence judgments | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | public versus private commitment | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Can be contaminated by background variability
   B. It proves increased liking for chosen options is unique.
   C. It makes self-concept threat irrelevant.
   D. Shifts the baseline

10. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. The passage implies that longitudinal attitude surveys directly measures causes, meaning confounding from public versus private commitment is impossible.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if longitudinal attitude surveys produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. Because public versus private commitment co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. it prevents increased liking for chosen options from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
