Passage 0732: Glacial Retreat and Moraine-Dated Landscape Change (Geology)
==========================================================================
(Word count: 709)

Despite the appeal of a single mechanism, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated
isostatic rebound indicators as the decisive sign of glacial retreat and moraine-dated
landscape change. Admittedly, remote sensing of glacier area can make the pattern look
unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using remote sensing of glacier area under stable conditions, one frequently cited case from
Himalayan glaciers appeared to support the direct-readout view. [A] The discussion makes
clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. Though the original fit looked
visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in temperature versus
precipitation controls altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic isostatic rebound
indicators. [B] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as
an embarrassment. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which illustrates why
boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. [C] The passage
highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. [D] The argument hinges
on what would change under an alternative explanation. In this sense, ice-front recession
recorded in moraines is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of glacial retreat and
moraine-dated landscape change: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the same
observation—isostatic rebound indicators—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat isostatic rebound
indicators as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify temperature versus
precipitation controls could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which remote sensing of
glacier area constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. a
single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, deglaciation-driven
geomorphic change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Using remote sensing of glacier area under stable conditions, one frequently cited case from
Himalayan glaciers appeared to support the direct-readout view. Although the original fit
looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in temperature
versus precipitation controls altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic isostatic rebound
indicators. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which forces analysts to admit
that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted.

Only after analysts began combining remote sensing of glacier area with cross-site
comparisons did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about glacial
retreat and moraine-dated landscape change stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which isostatic
rebound indicators could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
temperature versus precipitation controls often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a
move that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, retreating
glacier termini over decades is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about glacial
retreat and moraine-dated landscape change be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted that the temptation
to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which
isostatic rebound indicators is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where UAV photogrammetry constrains hazard cascades involving GLOFs
   B. The passage treats newly exposed proglacial lakes as a confounder and hazard cascades involving GLOFs as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The author argues that UAV photogrammetry should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'shrinkage of alpine glaciers' refers to a different field altogether, not to glacial retreat and moraine-dated landscape change.

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **attenuated** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [A] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like UAV photogrammetry are needed
   B. irrelevant to glacial retreat and moraine-dated landscape change, serving only as background detail
   C. weakened

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: Only after analysts began combining remote sensing of glacier area with cross-site comparisons did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about glacial retreat and moraine-dated landscape change stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on UAV photogrammetry simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates temperature versus precipitation controls.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because newly exposed proglacial lakes uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Himalayan glaciers and everywhere else.

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |

   B. Since river discharge seasonality shifts is observed in Himalayan glaciers, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. Because river discharge seasonality shifts appears, the mechanism must be unique, so hazard cascades involving GLOFs can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. it prevents river discharge seasonality shifts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control hazard cascades involving GLOFs

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that deglaciation-driven geomorphic change is settled because slope instability and rockfalls uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that temperature versus precipitation controls is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating as a historical curiosity and does not discuss slope instability and rockfalls or temperature versus precipitation controls. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines glacial retreat and moraine-dated landscape change and argues that slope instability and rockfalls is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how temperature versus precipitation controls can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Patagonian icefields. Finally, it maintains that tests combining cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about ice-front recession recorded in moraines robust.
   D. The passage argues that retreating glacier termini over decades cannot be studied empirically because confounders like temperature versus precipitation controls make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

   B. hazard cascades involving GLOFs alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. slope instability and rockfalls specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating as a device rather than as an analytic approach
