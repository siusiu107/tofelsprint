Passage 0098: Inflation Expectations and the Self-Fulfilling Side of Prices (Macroeconomics)
============================================================================================
(Word count: 610)

Inflation is often defined as a rise in the general price level, but it is also a story
people tell themselves about the future. If firms expect input costs to rise, they may raise
prices preemptively; if workers expect living costs to rise, they may demand higher wages;
if lenders expect inflation, they may require higher interest rates. These anticipatory
moves can, under certain conditions, help produce the very inflation that was feared.
Economists therefore pay close attention not only to realized inflation but also to
inflation expectations.

Expectations are not uniform. Households form beliefs from grocery bills and rent notices,
which can overweight salient items. Businesses may rely on supplier communications and
contract escalators. Financial markets embed expectations in bond yields and in inflation-
linked securities. Surveys add another layer, capturing stated beliefs that may differ from
behavior. [A] Because each measure reflects different incentives and information, economists
treat “expectations” as a family of indicators rather than a single number.

Central banks attempt to anchor expectations by convincing the public that inflation will
remain near a target. Credibility is crucial. If the public believes the bank will tighten
policy when inflation rises, then firms may hesitate to raise prices too aggressively, and
wage negotiations may moderate. Conversely, if credibility erodes—perhaps after repeated
surprises or political interference—beliefs can drift upward. In high-inflation episodes,
indexation clauses can become widespread, automatically adjusting wages and contracts to
past inflation, which can make inflation persistent even when demand weakens. [B] In that
case, yesterday’s prices become tomorrow’s rules.

The link between expectations and actual inflation is also shaped by supply shocks. An oil-
price spike can raise costs directly, and firms may pass those costs through. If households
interpret the spike as a temporary event, expectations may not change much. If they
interpret it as the beginning of a broader trend, expectations may rise and wage demands may
increase, amplifying the shock. Thus, the same supply event can have different inflationary
trajectories depending on how it is interpreted and institutionalized.

Policy tools are blunt. Raising interest rates can reduce demand, but it may not quickly
undo supply constraints, and it can raise unemployment. Communication strategies—forward
guidance, projections, and press conferences—aim to shape expectations without extreme rate
moves. Yet communication can backfire if messages are inconsistent or if the public suspects
that forecasts are political. [C] Managing expectations therefore resembles managing trust:
it is earned slowly and lost quickly.

Inflation expectations matter because they connect psychology to macroeconomics. [D] Prices
are not only outcomes; they are signals, and when signals change behavior, the future
becomes partially a product of belief.

When expectations shift, wage negotiations and price-setting can follow, turning a belief
into a self-reinforcing trend.

Central banks watch not only inflation itself but also surveys and bond markets, because
those signals hint at credibility.

When expectations shift, wage negotiations and price-setting can follow, turning a belief
into a self-reinforcing trend.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "salient" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Households form beliefs from grocery bills and rent notices, which can overweight salient items.
   A. peripheral to the author’s point, despite references to inflation and negotiations
   B. subtle and easy to miss, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. most noticeable or important, as used to describe how the claim holds across trend
   D. fully resolved and closed to debate, which would rule out further evaluation of trend

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents negotiations as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once inflation is observed, competing explanations for expectations collapse. It treats trend as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   B. The passage explains expectations by linking inflation to negotiations, and it shows why trend changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   C. The passage concedes that inflation is often incomplete and concludes that expectations cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since trend overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of negotiations with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, within the passage’s scope.
   D. The passage surveys expectations but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed negotiations first, with inflation serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats trend as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that trend mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes inflation effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of negotiations no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain expectations, given the evidence cited, for the phenomenon at issue.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in trend, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of inflation is enough to validate negotiations for expectations.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how expectations should change if trend is altered, instead of assuming that inflation has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to negotiations must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage treats inflation primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over negotiations are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about expectations are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of negotiations as a factor influencing inflation, especially regarding negotiations.
   B. discussion of archival bias as a factor influencing inflation
   C. discussion of trend as a factor influencing inflation
   D. discussion of expectations as a factor influencing inflation

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: If firms expect input costs to rise, they may raise prices preemptively; if workers expect living costs to rise, they may demand higher wages; if lenders expect inflation, they may require higher interest rates.
   A. If firms expect input costs to rise, they may raise prices preemptively. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding expectations.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   D. If firms expect input costs to rise, they may raise prices preemptively. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of negotiations guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in trend are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because comparability prevents negotiations from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold trend constant while examining inflation.
   C. Because once inflation fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and trend can be ignored without changing conclusions about expectations.
   D. Because inflation directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding expectations.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | inflation | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | trend | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It proves negotiations is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that expectations should be read alongside trend, because inflation alone does not settle what negotiations means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: These anticipatory moves can, under certain conditions, help produce the very inflation that was feared.
   A. the preceding claim that trend alone explains the outcome of expectations
   B. the preceding claim that inflation is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   C. the preceding claim that expectations functions as a direct measurement of negotiations
   D. the preceding claim about how inflation is interpreted in relation to negotiations

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of inflation lead to different conclusions about expectations.
   B. to show that the term expectations belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of inflation and negotiations should be abandoned altogether, especially regarding trend.
   D. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses negotiations, so debate over inflation is unnecessary noise, especially regarding inflation.
