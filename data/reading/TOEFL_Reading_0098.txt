Passage 0098: Inflation Expectations and the Self-Fulfilling Side of Prices (Macroeconomics)
============================================================================================
(Word count: 610)

Inflation is often defined as a rise in the general price level, but it is also a story
people tell themselves about the future. If firms expect input costs to rise, they may raise
prices preemptively; if workers expect living costs to rise, they may demand higher wages;
if lenders expect inflation, they may require higher interest rates. These anticipatory
moves can, under certain conditions, help produce the very inflation that was feared.
Economists therefore pay close attention not only to realized inflation but also to
inflation expectations.

Expectations are not uniform. Households form beliefs from grocery bills and rent notices,
which can overweight salient items. Businesses may rely on supplier communications and
contract escalators. Financial markets embed expectations in bond yields and in inflation-
linked securities. Surveys add another layer, capturing stated beliefs that may differ from
behavior. [A] Because each measure reflects different incentives and information, economists
treat “expectations” as a family of indicators rather than a single number.

Central banks attempt to anchor expectations by convincing the public that inflation will
remain near a target. Credibility is crucial. If the public believes the bank will tighten
policy when inflation rises, then firms may hesitate to raise prices too aggressively, and
wage negotiations may moderate. Conversely, if credibility erodes—perhaps after repeated
surprises or political interference—beliefs can drift upward. In high-inflation episodes,
indexation clauses can become widespread, automatically adjusting wages and contracts to
past inflation, which can make inflation persistent even when demand weakens. [B] In that
case, yesterday’s prices become tomorrow’s rules.

The link between expectations and actual inflation is also shaped by supply shocks. An oil-
price spike can raise costs directly, and firms may pass those costs through. If households
interpret the spike as a temporary event, expectations may not change much. If they
interpret it as the beginning of a broader trend, expectations may rise and wage demands may
increase, amplifying the shock. Thus, the same supply event can have different inflationary
trajectories depending on how it is interpreted and institutionalized.

Policy tools are blunt. Raising interest rates can reduce demand, but it may not quickly
undo supply constraints, and it can raise unemployment. Communication strategies—forward
guidance, projections, and press conferences—aim to shape expectations without extreme rate
moves. Yet communication can backfire if messages are inconsistent or if the public suspects
that forecasts are political. [C] Managing expectations therefore resembles managing trust:
it is earned slowly and lost quickly.

Inflation expectations matter because they connect psychology to macroeconomics. [D] Prices
are not only outcomes; they are signals, and when signals change behavior, the future
becomes partially a product of belief.

When expectations shift, wage negotiations and price-setting can follow, turning a belief
into a self-reinforcing trend.

Central banks watch not only inflation itself but also surveys and bond markets, because
those signals hint at credibility.

Questions
---------
1. [Sentence Insert] In which location would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: If people believe future prices will rise, their behavior today can help bring that rise about.
   A. [B]
   B. [D]
   C. [A]
   D. [C]


2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word “anchor” is closest in meaning to:
   A. to store objects in a warehouse
   B. to keep beliefs stable near a target through credibility
   C. to reverse a decision completely
   D. to confuse the reader with unrelated details


3. [Factual] According to the passage, which statement is supported?
   A. inflation expectations plays a central role in the process described, interacting with central bank credibility rather than acting alone. This would require high-inflation to be the limiting factor.
   B. inflation expectations plays a central role in the process described, interacting with central bank surveys rather than acting alone. This outcome would hold even if high-inflation stays constant.
   C. inflation expectations plays a central role in the process described, interacting with central bank credibility rather than acting alone.
   D. inflation expectations plays a central role in the process described, interacting with central bank credibility rather than acting alone. This would occur only when interpret dominates.


4. [Negative Factual] All of the following are discussed in the passage EXCEPT:
   A. a description of how serotinous cones open during crown fires.
   B. the role of inflation expectations in shaping outcomes.
   C. limitations or trade-offs involving wage demands in this discussion.
   D. how central bank credibility modifies or mediates the central phenomenon.


5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author introduce competing ideas or alternative interpretations?
   A. to show that explaining inflation communication requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account. This would require communication to be the limiting factor.
   B. to show that explaining inflation expectations requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account. This would occur only when expectations dominates.
   C. to show that explaining inflation expectations requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account.
   D. to show that explaining inflation expectations requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account. That would make economists the primary constraint.


6. [Inference] Which inference is most strongly supported by the passage?
   A. Changes in central bank credibility must shift the consequences of inflation expectations, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same. That would make economists the primary constraint.
   B. Changes in central bank credibility can shift the consequences of inflation different, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same. This outcome would hold even if surveys stays constant.
   C. Changes in central bank credibility can solely shift the consequences of inflation expectations, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same. This would occur only when households dominates.
   D. Changes in central bank credibility can shift the consequences of inflation expectations, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same.


7. [Reference] In the passage, the phrase “the system” most nearly refers to:
   A. the interconnected set of processes involving inflation expectations, central bank credibility, and related constraints described by the author. This would require communication to be the limiting factor.
   B. the interconnected set of processes involving inflation communication, central bank credibility, and related constraints described by the author. This would occur only when negotiations dominates.
   C. the interconnected set of processes involving inflation expectations, central bank credibility, and related constraints described by the author. That would make credibility the primary constraint.

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the author’s main point?
   A. The passage argues that inflation expectations is best understood through its interactions with central bank credibility and wage demands, rather than through a one-cause story. That would make economists the primary constraint.
   B. The passage argues that inflation expectations is best understood through its interactions with central bank credibility and wage demands, rather than through a one-cause story.
   C. The passage argues that macroeconomics expectations is best understood through its interactions with central bank credibility and wage demands, rather than through a one-cause story. This would occur only when policy dominates.
   D. The passage argues that inflation expectations is solely best understood through its interactions with central bank credibility and wage demands, rather than through a one-cause story. That would make negotiations the primary constraint.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage explains inflation expectations by describing underlying mechanisms and showing how central bank credibility and wage demands shape outcomes, emphasizing constraints and trade-offs rather than a uniform template.
