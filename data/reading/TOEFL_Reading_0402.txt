Passage 0402: Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments (Psychology)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 628)

From a cognitive-control perspective, researchers found that researchers have treated
context-dependent effects as the decisive sign of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory
experiments. Even if process-dissociation procedures can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather
than rely on familiar narratives.

Even if the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. [A] The argument hinges on what
would change under an alternative explanation. it highlights how inhibitory control
differences can shift baselines, altering whether context-dependent effects is even
comparable across cases, which helps explain why means that a good fit is not the same as a
good explanation. [B] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows. If
inhibitory control differences is changed while the nominal driver remains constant, one
should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. [C] The author uses the
detour to show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. [D] The
discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. In this sense,
practice-driven suppression of competing memories is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Only after analysts began combining process-dissociation procedures with cross-site
comparisons did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about retrieval-
induced forgetting in memory experiments stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which context-
dependent effects could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like
inhibitory control differences often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in
turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on inhibitory control differences, many
early studies framed retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments as a single-
mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized context-dependent effects as a
signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same signature survives when
protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under replication. this shift
mattered for how evidence from classroom study settings was generalized largely because
local conditions can change which processes generate context-dependent effects. In this
sense, retrieval-based inhibition is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of retrieval-induced
forgetting in memory experiments: inference is constrained by what competing models would
also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation is granted, then the
same observation—context-dependent effects—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat context-dependent effects
as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. In this
sense, selective recall causing forgetting is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about retrieval-
induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why
the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Admittedly, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong;
nevertheless, the result is a framework in which context-dependent effects is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that selective recall causing forgetting cannot be studied empirically because confounders like stress modulation of recall make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting fMRI pattern analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments and argues that metacognitive illusions is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how stress modulation of recall can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from classroom study settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining fMRI pattern analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about practice-driven suppression of competing memories robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats fMRI pattern analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss metacognitive illusions or stress modulation of recall. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that retrieval-based inhibition is settled because metacognitive illusions uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that stress modulation of recall is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using fMRI pattern analysis are unnecessary.

2. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that strategy shifts over trials is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The author treats laboratory paradigms as a special case and argues that no broader inference about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments is possible.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving recognition tests.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when encoding strength heterogeneity can mimic strategy shifts over trials.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. process-dissociation procedures
   B. Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments
   C. a list of Olympic medal counts
   D. reduced recall of unpracticed items

4. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if paired-associate tasks produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. it prevents strategy shifts over trials from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control inhibitory control differences
   C. Because strategy shifts over trials appears, the mechanism must be unique, so inhibitory control differences can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once strategy shifts over trials is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: it highlights how inhibitory control differences can shift baselines, altering whether context-dependent effects is even comparable across cases, which helps explain why means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. stress modulation of recall alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. context-dependent effects specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. process-dissociation procedures as a device rather than as an analytic approach

   A. The passage treats context-dependent effects as a confounder and encoding strength heterogeneity as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The author argues that process-dissociation procedures should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'practice-driven suppression of competing memories' refers to a different field altogether, not to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where process-dissociation procedures constrains encoding strength heterogeneity

8. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **persistent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:

   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because encoding strength heterogeneity dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like fMRI pattern analysis are needed
   C. lasting
   D. irrelevant to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments, serving only as background detail

   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because strategy shifts over trials uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on paired-associate tasks simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in clinical populations and everywhere else.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates encoding strength heterogeneity.
