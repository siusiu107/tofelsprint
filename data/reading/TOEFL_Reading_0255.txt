Passage 0255: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 768)

When memory is tested repeatedly, the analysis suggests researchers have treated selective
memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization. Even though choice-induced preference paradigms can make the
pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. In replication attempts, one sees why
the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike
consumer choice studies. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying
mechanisms differed because public versus private commitment shifted the baseline in
different directions across sites, which is why replication matters. So the author therefore
separates detection from interpretation, and so, too, does the evidence undermine treating
selective memory for supporting evidence as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense,
post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike consumer choice studies. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because public versus
private commitment shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. The issue is
not treating selective memory for supporting evidence as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is
that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. The decisive factor is
methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as the lesson of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. [A] This point forces the reader to consider how
confounders enter the pipeline. Were one wishes to move from description to explanation to
fail, then the same observation—selective memory for supporting evidence—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The author shifts from
narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. Whereas popular summaries
treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts
forces boundary conditions to be stated. [C] This detail becomes important later, when
assumptions are tested. [D] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. Only when the field
adopted tests that manipulate or stratify public versus private commitment did the debate
became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which
choice-induced preference paradigms constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. While it is true that a single case can be dramatic, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. It is methodological humility that the
passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move
from description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—selective memory for
supporting evidence—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an
endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. Not the
obvious explanation but the apparent regularity of selective memory for supporting evidence
is what drives the first interpretation: selective memory for supporting evidence is treated
as a direct readout of mechanism. If selective memory for supporting evidence is uniquely
produced by one causal pathway is granted, then observations from consumer choice studies
would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. The issue is not the
caveat that public versus private commitment might reproduce the same pattern; it is that
the literature is full of such claims. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, the analysis
suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that
forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. measurement reactivity alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. implicit association tests as a device rather than as an analytic approach

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | implicit association tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | increased liking for chosen options | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | cultural norms about consistency | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. May not generalize across contexts
   B. It replaces meta-analytic synthesis with intuition.
   C. Shifts the baseline
   D. It makes measurement reactivity irrelevant.

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on implicit association tests simple.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in workplace decision settings and everywhere else.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   B. longitudinal attitude surveys
   C. selective memory for supporting evidence
   D. the author’s favorite color

5. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. Because shifted confidence judgments appears, the mechanism must be unique, so public versus private commitment can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
   C. Since shifted confidence judgments is observed in political opinion panels, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because public versus private commitment co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

6. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [A] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   B. important
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like choice-induced preference paradigms are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because cultural norms about consistency dominates all evidence

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting meta-analytic synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using meta-analytic synthesis are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats meta-analytic synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining meta-analytic synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The passage treats increased liking for chosen options as a confounder and cultural norms about consistency as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The author argues that meta-analytic synthesis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where meta-analytic synthesis constrains cultural norms about consistency
   D. The passage implies that consumer choice studies is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: As a result, the most valuable observations are often taken during transitions, when competing mechanisms diverge most clearly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

10. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that shifted confidence judgments is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving behavioral priming designs.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic shifted confidence judgments.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away public versus private commitment, since variability is merely a measurement error.
