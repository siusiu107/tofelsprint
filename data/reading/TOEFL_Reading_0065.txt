Passage 0065: Kelp Forests, Sea Urchins, and Why Ecosystems Can Flip to Barrens (Ecology)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 615)

Along many temperate coasts, kelp forests function as underwater analogues of terrestrial
forests. Giant kelp can grow meters in a month, forming a three-dimensional canopy that
dampens waves, shelters fish, and supports diverse invertebrates. Yet kelp forests can
collapse abruptly into “urchin barrens,” landscapes dominated by spiny sea urchins that
graze kelp down to short, scrubby algae. Understanding why such regime shifts occur has
become a central question in coastal ecology.

At the core is a simple interaction: sea urchins eat kelp. When urchin numbers are low, kelp
can outgrow grazing, and the forest persists. When urchin density rises or when kelp growth
slows due to storms, heat, or nutrient limitation, grazing can outpace regrowth and the
forest can unravel. Predators that eat urchins—sea otters, lobsters, and some fish—therefore
play an outsized role in maintaining kelp. Sea otters are particularly influential because
they can consume large numbers of urchins, including the larger individuals that are most
reproductively productive. [A] In regions where otters are abundant, urchin populations can
be kept in check, allowing kelp to maintain a dense canopy.

Classic studies described this as a trophic cascade: predators indirectly protect plants by
suppressing herbivores. However, the cascade is not automatic everywhere. In some systems,
urchins can hide in crevices, emerging to graze only when food is scarce, which reduces
predator access. In others, predators prefer alternative prey when it is abundant, allowing
urchins to escape control. Moreover, kelp itself can influence grazing. Dense kelp can
provide detritus—broken kelp fragments—that feed urchins without requiring them to leave
shelter, ironically supporting the very grazers that can destroy the forest. [B] The
kelp–urchin relationship is thus not merely “plant versus herbivore,” but a feedback loop
shaped by shelter, detritus, and predator behavior.

Human history also matters. In the North Pacific, fur trade hunting reduced sea otter
numbers drastically in many areas, which likely allowed urchins to expand. In some places,
otter populations recovered, and kelp forests returned; in others, barrens persisted for
decades. Persistence can be explained by alternative stable states. Once urchins dominate,
they can prevent kelp from re-establishing by grazing new recruits. The absence of kelp
reduces habitat for urchin predators and reduces the canopy that might otherwise buffer wave
energy and create favorable conditions for kelp seedlings. A barren can therefore be “self-
reinforcing,” requiring a strong push—such as predator return or targeted urchin removal—to
flip back to a forest.

Climate change adds another layer of instability. Marine heatwaves can reduce nutrient
upwelling and stress kelp, making it more vulnerable to grazing. Storm intensity can
physically remove kelp and create openings. In warmer conditions, disease can affect
predators or grazers in asymmetric ways. For management, this means that protecting
predators alone may not always be sufficient. Some restoration projects remove urchins
directly, while others reintroduce predators or seed kelp in protected microhabitats. [C]
The most effective strategies often combine approaches, acknowledging that feedbacks can
lock a system into a state that is resilient in the wrong direction.

Kelp forests, then, illustrate how ecosystems can hinge on a few interactions. [D] A shift
in predator abundance, a burst of heat stress, or a change in urchin behavior can tip a
coastline from a layered, productive forest into a sparse, grazing- dominated plain—and the
return path may be harder than the collapse.

In restoration sites, transplanting kelp without reducing urchin density can amount to
planting seedlings in a field of grazers.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] What can be inferred about why urchin barrens can persist for long periods once established?
   A. High urchin grazing prevents kelp recruitment, and the lack of kelp reduces predator habitat, reinforcing the barren state
   B. Kelp cannot grow in seawater and therefore never returns
   C. Sea otters only eat kelp and thus accelerate collapse
   D. Storms permanently remove all nutrients from coastal waters

2. [Factual] According to the passage, why are sea otters described as particularly influential predators in some kelp systems?
   A. They can consume many urchins, including large individuals that contribute strongly to reproduction
   B. They fertilize kelp by releasing nitrogen-rich gases
   C. They prevent marine heatwaves from occurring
   D. They convert kelp directly into new canopy through photosynthesis

3. [Vocabulary] The word “regime” in “regime shifts” is closest in meaning to:
   A. a dominant ecological state or set of conditions
   B. a legal framework for shipping lanes
   C. a microscopic parasite in kelp tissue
   D. a tidal wave caused by earthquakes

4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because feedbacks can amplify small changes, the boundary between forest and barren can be surprisingly sharp.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as factors influencing kelp–urchin dynamics EXCEPT:
   A. urchins hiding in crevices
   B. predators switching to alternative prey
   C. detritus feeding urchins in shelters
   D. lead poisoning of catalytic converter surfaces

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author introduce the idea of “alternative stable states”?
   A. To explain how feedbacks can lock ecosystems into kelp or barren conditions and make reversals difficult
   B. To argue that predators never matter in any ecosystem
   C. To claim that climate change affects only terrestrial forests
   D. To show that urchins always prefer detritus to living kelp

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the return path” refers to:
   A. the process of shifting from an urchin barren back to a kelp forest
   B. sea otters swimming back to shore after hunting
   C. kelp fragments drifting offshore
   D. heatwaves reversing into cold spells

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It describes kelp forests and their collapse to barrens, explains predator–urchin–kelp interactions and feedbacks, then considers historical and climate influences and restoration implications
   B. It provides only a taxonomy of kelp species
   C. It argues that kelp collapse is caused exclusively by storms
   D. It focuses only on fish behavior without mentioning urchins

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the feedback involving detritus?
   A. Dense kelp can generate drifting fragments that allow urchins to feed while staying sheltered, indirectly sustaining grazer populations
   B. Detritus prevents urchins from eating kelp because it is toxic
   C. Only barrens produce detritus because kelp is absent
   D. Urchins create detritus by dissolving rocks into silt

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Kelp forests always persist because kelp grows faster than any grazer can eat it.
   B. The passage explains how kelp forests can shift into urchin barrens when grazing outpaces regrowth, how predators such as sea otters can suppress urchins but feedbacks and behavioral refuges complicate simple cascades, and why history, climate stress, and management interventions affect whether systems collapse or recover.
   C. Urchin barrens form only when kelp is poisoned by sulfur compounds.
   D. Sea otters reduce kelp by eating it directly, creating barrens that are easy to reverse.
