Passage 0065: Kelp Forests, Sea Urchins, and Why Ecosystems Can Flip to Barrens (Ecology)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 615)

Along many temperate coasts, kelp forests function as underwater analogues of terrestrial
forests. Giant kelp can grow meters in a month, forming a three-dimensional canopy that
dampens waves, shelters fish, and supports diverse invertebrates. Yet kelp forests can
collapse abruptly into “urchin barrens,” landscapes dominated by spiny sea urchins that
graze kelp down to short, scrubby algae. Understanding why such regime shifts occur has
become a central question in coastal ecology.

At the core is a simple interaction: sea urchins eat kelp. When urchin numbers are low, kelp
can outgrow grazing, and the forest persists. When urchin density rises or when kelp growth
slows due to storms, heat, or nutrient limitation, grazing can outpace regrowth and the
forest can unravel. Predators that eat urchins—sea otters, lobsters, and some fish—therefore
play an outsized role in maintaining kelp. Sea otters are particularly influential because
they can consume large numbers of urchins, including the larger individuals that are most
reproductively productive. [A] In regions where otters are abundant, urchin populations can
be kept in check, allowing kelp to maintain a dense canopy.

Classic studies described this as a trophic cascade: predators indirectly protect plants by
suppressing herbivores. However, the cascade is not automatic everywhere. In some systems,
urchins can hide in crevices, emerging to graze only when food is scarce, which reduces
predator access. In others, predators prefer alternative prey when it is abundant, allowing
urchins to escape control. Moreover, kelp itself can influence grazing. Dense kelp can
provide detritus—broken kelp fragments—that feed urchins without requiring them to leave
shelter, ironically supporting the very grazers that can destroy the forest. [B] The
kelp–urchin relationship is thus not merely “plant versus herbivore,” but a feedback loop
shaped by shelter, detritus, and predator behavior.

Human history also matters. In the North Pacific, fur trade hunting reduced sea otter
numbers drastically in many areas, which likely allowed urchins to expand. In some places,
otter populations recovered, and kelp forests returned; in others, barrens persisted for
decades. Persistence can be explained by alternative stable states. Once urchins dominate,
they can prevent kelp from re-establishing by grazing new recruits. The absence of kelp
reduces habitat for urchin predators and reduces the canopy that might otherwise buffer wave
energy and create favorable conditions for kelp seedlings. A barren can therefore be “self-
reinforcing,” requiring a strong push—such as predator return or targeted urchin removal—to
flip back to a forest.

Climate change adds another layer of instability. Marine heatwaves can reduce nutrient
upwelling and stress kelp, making it more vulnerable to grazing. Storm intensity can
physically remove kelp and create openings. In warmer conditions, disease can affect
predators or grazers in asymmetric ways. For management, this means that protecting
predators alone may not always be sufficient. Some restoration projects remove urchins
directly, while others reintroduce predators or seed kelp in protected microhabitats. [C]
The most effective strategies often combine approaches, acknowledging that feedbacks can
lock a system into a state that is resilient in the wrong direction.

Kelp forests, then, illustrate how ecosystems can hinge on a few interactions. [D] A shift
in predator abundance, a burst of heat stress, or a change in urchin behavior can tip a
coastline from a layered, productive forest into a sparse, grazing- dominated plain—and the
return path may be harder than the collapse.

In restoration sites, transplanting kelp without reducing urchin density can amount to
planting seedlings in a field of grazers.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] A shift in predator abundance, a burst of heat stress, or a change in urchin behavior can tip a coastline from a layered, productive forest into a sparse, grazing- dominated plain—and the return path may be harder than the collapse.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to urchins and predators
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across grazing
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of grazing
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that urchins is often incomplete and concludes that urchin cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since grazing overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of predators with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage explains urchin by linking urchins to predators, and it shows why grazing changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   C. The passage presents predators as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once urchins is observed, competing explanations for urchin collapse. It treats grazing as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding predators.
   D. The passage surveys urchin but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed predators first, with urchins serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats grazing as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that grazing mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes urchins effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of predators no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain urchin, within the passage’s scope, in the context of the passage.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in grazing, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of urchins is enough to validate predators for urchin.
   C. The passage treats urchins primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over predators are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about urchin are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how urchin should change if grazing is altered, instead of assuming that urchins has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to predators must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of grazing as a factor influencing urchins
   B. discussion of predators as a factor influencing urchins
   C. discussion of urchin as a factor influencing urchins, especially regarding urchins.
   D. discussion of stress corrosion cracking as a factor influencing urchins

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] A shift in predator abundance, a burst of heat stress, or a change in urchin behavior can tip a coastline from a layered, productive forest into a sparse, grazing- dominated plain—and the return path may be harder than the collapse.
   A. [D] A shift in predator abundance. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   D. [D] A shift in predator abundance. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents predators from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold grazing constant while examining urchins.
   B. Because urchins directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding urchin.
   C. Because the presence of predators guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in grazing are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because once urchins fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and grazing can be ignored without changing conclusions about urchin.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | urchins | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | grazing | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves predators is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that urchin should be read alongside grazing, because urchins alone does not settle what predators means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Classic studies described this as a trophic cascade: predators indirectly protect plants by suppressing herbivores.
   A. the idea that [A] In regions where otters are abundant, urchin populations can be kept in check, allowing kelp to maintain a dense canopy
   B. the idea that However, the cascade is not automatic everywhere, as the argument develops, as the discussion implies, within the passage’s scope.
   C. the idea that In some places, otter populations recovered, and kelp forests returned; in others, barrens persisted for decades
   D. the idea that Sea otters are particularly influential because they can consume large numbers of urchins, including the larger individuals that are most reproductively productive
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses predators, so debate over urchins is unnecessary noise, especially regarding urchin.
   B. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of urchins and predators should be abandoned altogether.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of urchins lead to different conclusions about urchin.
   D. to show that the term urchin belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, as the discussion implies.
