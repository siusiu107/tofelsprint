Passage 0065: Kelp Forests, Sea Urchins, and Why Ecosystems Can Flip to Barrens (Ecology)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 615)

Along many temperate coasts, kelp forests function as underwater analogues of terrestrial
forests. Giant kelp can grow meters in a month, forming a three-dimensional canopy that
dampens waves, shelters fish, and supports diverse invertebrates. Yet kelp forests can
collapse abruptly into “urchin barrens,” landscapes dominated by spiny sea urchins that
graze kelp down to short, scrubby algae. Understanding why such regime shifts occur has
become a central question in coastal ecology.

At the core is a simple interaction: sea urchins eat kelp. When urchin numbers are low, kelp
can outgrow grazing, and the forest persists. When urchin density rises or when kelp growth
slows due to storms, heat, or nutrient limitation, grazing can outpace regrowth and the
forest can unravel. Predators that eat urchins—sea otters, lobsters, and some fish—therefore
play an outsized role in maintaining kelp. Sea otters are particularly influential because
they can consume large numbers of urchins, including the larger individuals that are most
reproductively productive. [A] In regions where otters are abundant, urchin populations can
be kept in check, allowing kelp to maintain a dense canopy.

Classic studies described this as a trophic cascade: predators indirectly protect plants by
suppressing herbivores. However, the cascade is not automatic everywhere. In some systems,
urchins can hide in crevices, emerging to graze only when food is scarce, which reduces
predator access. In others, predators prefer alternative prey when it is abundant, allowing
urchins to escape control. Moreover, kelp itself can influence grazing. Dense kelp can
provide detritus—broken kelp fragments—that feed urchins without requiring them to leave
shelter, ironically supporting the very grazers that can destroy the forest. [B] The
kelp–urchin relationship is thus not merely “plant versus herbivore,” but a feedback loop
shaped by shelter, detritus, and predator behavior.

Human history also matters. In the North Pacific, fur trade hunting reduced sea otter
numbers drastically in many areas, which likely allowed urchins to expand. In some places,
otter populations recovered, and kelp forests returned; in others, barrens persisted for
decades. Persistence can be explained by alternative stable states. Once urchins dominate,
they can prevent kelp from re-establishing by grazing new recruits. The absence of kelp
reduces habitat for urchin predators and reduces the canopy that might otherwise buffer wave
energy and create favorable conditions for kelp seedlings. A barren can therefore be “self-
reinforcing,” requiring a strong push—such as predator return or targeted urchin removal—to
flip back to a forest.

Climate change adds another layer of instability. Marine heatwaves can reduce nutrient
upwelling and stress kelp, making it more vulnerable to grazing. Storm intensity can
physically remove kelp and create openings. In warmer conditions, disease can affect
predators or grazers in asymmetric ways. For management, this means that protecting
predators alone may not always be sufficient. Some restoration projects remove urchins
directly, while others reintroduce predators or seed kelp in protected microhabitats. [C]
The most effective strategies often combine approaches, acknowledging that feedbacks can
lock a system into a state that is resilient in the wrong direction.

Kelp forests, then, illustrate how ecosystems can hinge on a few interactions. [D] A shift
in predator abundance, a burst of heat stress, or a change in urchin behavior can tip a
coastline from a layered, productive forest into a sparse, grazing- dominated plain—and the
return path may be harder than the collapse.

In restoration sites, transplanting kelp without reducing urchin density can amount to
planting seedlings in a field of grazers.

Questions
---------
1. [Inference] What can be inferred about why urchin barrens can persist for long periods once established?
   A. High urchin grazing prevents kelp recruitment, and the lack of kelp reduces predator habitat, reinforcing the barren state by tying the effect to climate.
   B. High urchin grazing prevents kelp recruitment, and the lack of kelp reduces predator habitat, reinforcing the barren state.
   C. High urchin grazing prevents kelp recruitment, and the lack of kelp reduces predator habitat, reinforcing the barren state. This would occur only when north dominates.
   D. High urchin grazing prevents kelp recruitment, and the lack of kelp reduces predator habitat, reinforcing the barren state. This outcome would hold even if urchins stays constant.


2. [Factual] According to the passage, why are sea otters described as particularly influential predators in some kelp systems?
   A. They can consume many urchins, including large individuals that contribute strongly to reproduction.
   B. They can consume many giant, including large individuals that contribute strongly to reproduction. This would require forests to be the limiting factor.
   C. They must consume many urchins, including large individuals that contribute strongly to reproduction. That would make storm the primary constraint.
   D. They can solely consume many urchins, including large individuals that contribute strongly to reproduction. This outcome would hold even if marine stays constant.


3. [Vocabulary] The word “regime” in “regime shifts” is closest in meaning to:
   A. a dominant ecological state or set of conditions
   B. a microscopic parasite in kelp tissue
   C. a legal framework for shipping lanes
