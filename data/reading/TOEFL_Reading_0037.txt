Passage 0037: Circadian Clocks, Light Timing, and Why the Body Argues with Night (Neuroscience)
===============================================================================================
(Word count: 645)

A person who flies across several time zones can feel as if their body has been broken into
parts. Hunger arrives at odd hours, sleep comes reluctantly, and attention frays in the
afternoon. The mismatch reveals that time is not only a clock on a wall; it is also a
biological program. Most mammals possess circadian rhythms—roughly 24‑hour cycles—in hormone
release, body temperature, and sleep propensity. These rhythms are not passive reactions to
daylight. They are generated by internal molecular loops and then synchronized, or
entrained, to the external day.

At the center of this timing system sits a small region of the hypothalamus called the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Neurons in the SCN contain genes whose products inhibit their
own production in a delayed feedback loop, creating an oscillation. One set of proteins
accumulates, shuts down its own gene transcription, degrades, and allows transcription to
restart, producing a cycle. [A] Because thousands of SCN neurons coordinate, the signal
becomes reliable enough to act as a master pacemaker for the body.

Light is the most powerful synchronizer. Specialized retinal cells send signals to the SCN
when they detect ambient light, especially in the blue range. Morning light tends to advance
the clock, making the body ready for sleep earlier, whereas evening light tends to delay it.
This is why bright screens at night can make sleep onset harder: they supply the brain with
a cue that resembles late-day sunlight. The SCN communicates timing to other tissues through
neural and hormonal signals, including modulation of melatonin. Melatonin is produced by the
pineal gland at night and can promote sleepiness, but its deeper role is as a chemical
message: “it is dark now.”

Circadian timing affects more than sleep. Body temperature reaches a low point during the
biological night, and cognitive performance often tracks its rise. Metabolism also follows
circadian patterns; glucose tolerance can differ between morning and evening. If a person
eats at a time that is out of phase with their internal clock—late-night meals, for
example—metabolic processes may be less prepared to handle the influx. Over time, persistent
misalignment, as in rotating shift work, has been associated with higher risks of metabolic
disorders. [B] The causal pathway is plausible: hormones that regulate appetite and insulin
sensitivity are timed, and repeated disruption can strain the system.

The clock is not a dictator, however. People differ in chronotype: some naturally wake
early, others late. Genetics plays a role, but so do age and environment. Adolescents often
experience a phase delay, making early school start times especially challenging. Older
adults may shift earlier again. Social schedules can therefore conflict with biology, and
conflict can become chronic sleep debt. Importantly, sleep debt is not repaid only by
“sleeping in” on weekends; irregular sleep times can further destabilize the rhythm, keeping
the body in a state of ongoing adjustment.

Because light can shift the clock, it can also be used therapeutically. Bright-light therapy
in the morning can help advance rhythms in people with delayed sleep phase. Carefully timed
light exposure can aid adaptation to night shifts, though it requires controlling daytime
light as well. Some treatments combine light with melatonin taken at specific hours, using
one cue to push and another to pull the rhythm. [C] The effectiveness depends on timing; the
same stimulus can have opposite effects depending on when it is delivered.

Circadian rhythms, then, are best understood as an internal architecture that expects
regularity. When regularity is present—consistent light-dark cycles and consistent meal
times—the clock coordinates physiology efficiently. When regularity is absent, physiology
becomes a negotiation among competing cues. [D] Jet lag is a temporary glimpse of that
negotiation; long-term shift work is its chronic form. In both cases, the body’s discomfort
is evidence that timekeeping is a biological function with consequences that extend from
sleep to metabolism to mood.


Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author open with the experience of jet lag?
   A. To illustrate, in a familiar way, that the body has internal timing programs that can become misaligned with local time
   B. To argue that travel causes permanent brain damage
   C. To show that circadian rhythms depend only on hunger
   D. To claim that clocks on walls control hormones directly

2. [Vocabulary] The word “entrained” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. synchronized to an external cue
   B. blocked by a barrier
   C. randomized by noise
   D. made longer than 24 hours

3. [Factual] According to the passage, what role does the SCN play?
   A. It acts as a master pacemaker that coordinates circadian signals in the body
   B. It produces melatonin directly at night
   C. It is a retinal cell that detects blue light
   D. It stores glucose in the liver

4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: A single cell’s rhythm would be fragile, but a coordinated network can keep time even when individual components vary.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Inference] What can be inferred about why late-night screen use can delay sleep?
   A. Blue-rich light signals the SCN in a way that resembles evening daylight, shifting the clock later
   B. Screens reduce melatonin by cooling the pineal gland
   C. Screens stop the SCN’s gene loop from functioning
   D. Screens make people hungry, which directly causes sleep

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as circadian-influenced processes EXCEPT:
   A. body temperature
   B. glucose tolerance
   C. hormone release
   D. plate subduction rates

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the same stimulus” refers to:
   A. light exposure that can advance or delay rhythms depending on timing
   B. a meal that always improves glucose tolerance
   C. melatonin that always delays the clock regardless of hour
   D. a flight that always advances the clock

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces circadian misalignment, explains the SCN and light entrainment, then traces broader effects on physiology and ends with therapeutic use of timing cues
   B. It lists hormones without discussing light
   C. It argues that circadian rhythms are irrelevant to health
   D. It focuses on gene names without linking to behavior

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that melatonin’s deeper role is a message that “it is dark now”?
   A. Melatonin serves as a signal of night to body tissues, helping coordinate timing beyond simply causing sleepiness
   B. Melatonin is produced only in bright light to wake the brain
   C. Melatonin replaces the SCN as the master clock
   D. Melatonin is an eye pigment that detects blue light

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Circadian rhythms are passive reactions to sunlight and have no molecular basis.
   B. The passage explains circadian rhythms as internally generated gene-based cycles coordinated by the SCN and synchronized by light, shows how timing affects sleep and metabolism and why misalignment can be harmful, and describes how timed light and melatonin can shift rhythms when applied appropriately.
   C. Jet lag occurs because the SCN stores food in the retina.
   D. Chronotype differences mean that light cannot affect biological clocks.
