Passage 0037: Circadian Clocks, Light Timing, and Why the Body Argues with Night (Neuroscience)
===============================================================================================
(Word count: 645)

A person who flies across several time zones can feel as if their body has been broken into
parts. Hunger arrives at odd hours, sleep comes reluctantly, and attention frays in the
afternoon. The mismatch reveals that time is not only a clock on a wall; it is also a
biological program. Most mammals possess circadian rhythms—roughly 24‑hour cycles—in hormone
release, body temperature, and sleep propensity. These rhythms are not passive reactions to
daylight. They are generated by internal molecular loops and then synchronized, or
entrained, to the external day.

At the center of this timing system sits a small region of the hypothalamus called the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Neurons in the SCN contain genes whose products inhibit their
own production in a delayed feedback loop, creating an oscillation. One set of proteins
accumulates, shuts down its own gene transcription, degrades, and allows transcription to
restart, producing a cycle. [A] Because thousands of SCN neurons coordinate, the signal
becomes reliable enough to act as a master pacemaker for the body.

Light is the most powerful synchronizer. Specialized retinal cells send signals to the SCN
when they detect ambient light, especially in the blue range. Morning light tends to advance
the clock, making the body ready for sleep earlier, whereas evening light tends to delay it.
This is why bright screens at night can make sleep onset harder: they supply the brain with
a cue that resembles late-day sunlight. The SCN communicates timing to other tissues through
neural and hormonal signals, including modulation of melatonin. Melatonin is produced by the
pineal gland at night and can promote sleepiness, but its deeper role is as a chemical
message: “it is dark now.”

Circadian timing affects more than sleep. Body temperature reaches a low point during the
biological night, and cognitive performance often tracks its rise. Metabolism also follows
circadian patterns; glucose tolerance can differ between morning and evening. If a person
eats at a time that is out of phase with their internal clock—late-night meals, for
example—metabolic processes may be less prepared to handle the influx. Over time, persistent
misalignment, as in rotating shift work, has been associated with higher risks of metabolic
disorders. [B] The causal pathway is plausible: hormones that regulate appetite and insulin
sensitivity are timed, and repeated disruption can strain the system.

The clock is not a dictator, however. People differ in chronotype: some naturally wake
early, others late. Genetics plays a role, but so do age and environment. Adolescents often
experience a phase delay, making early school start times especially challenging. Older
adults may shift earlier again. Social schedules can therefore conflict with biology, and
conflict can become chronic sleep debt. Importantly, sleep debt is not repaid only by
“sleeping in” on weekends; irregular sleep times can further destabilize the rhythm, keeping
the body in a state of ongoing adjustment.

Because light can shift the clock, it can also be used therapeutically. Bright-light therapy
in the morning can help advance rhythms in people with delayed sleep phase. Carefully timed
light exposure can aid adaptation to night shifts, though it requires controlling daytime
light as well. Some treatments combine light with melatonin taken at specific hours, using
one cue to push and another to pull the rhythm. [C] The effectiveness depends on timing; the
same stimulus can have opposite effects depending on when it is delivered.

Circadian rhythms, then, are best understood as an internal architecture that expects
regularity. When regularity is present—consistent light-dark cycles and consistent meal
times—the clock coordinates physiology efficiently. When regularity is absent, physiology
becomes a negotiation among competing cues. [D] Jet lag is a temporary glimpse of that
negotiation; long-term shift work is its chronic form. In both cases, the body’s discomfort
is evidence that timekeeping is a biological function with consequences that extend from
sleep to metabolism to mood.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "inhibit" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Neurons in the SCN contain genes whose products inhibit their own production in a delayed feedback loop, creating an oscillation.
   A. cause and accelerate, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related, especially regarding sleep.
   B. leave unaffected, despite references to light and clock, as the discussion implies.
   C. complete and finalize, which would rule out further evaluation of circadian
   D. prevent or slow down, as used to describe how the claim holds across circadian

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys sleep but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed clock first, with light serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats circadian as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   B. The passage concedes that light is often incomplete and concludes that sleep cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since circadian overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of clock with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage explains sleep by linking light to clock, and it shows why circadian changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage presents clock as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once light is observed, competing explanations for sleep collapse. It treats circadian as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, given the evidence cited.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in circadian, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of light is enough to validate clock for sleep.
   B. The passage implies that circadian mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes light effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of clock no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain sleep, especially regarding clock, for the phenomenon at issue, as framed by the author.
   C. The passage treats light primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over clock are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about sleep are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how sleep should change if circadian is altered, instead of assuming that light has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to clock must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of radiocarbon reservoir effects as a factor influencing light
   B. discussion of circadian as a factor influencing light
   C. discussion of clock as a factor influencing light, in the cases described.
   D. discussion of sleep as a factor influencing light

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: If a person eats at a time that is out of phase with their internal clock—late-night meals, for example—metabolic processes may be less prepared to handle the influx.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding timing, especially regarding clock.
   B. If a person eats at a time that is out of phase with their internal clock—late-night meals. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. If a person eats at a time that is out of phase with their internal clock—late-night meals. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, for the phenomenon at issue.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of clock guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in circadian are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because comparability prevents clock from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold circadian constant while examining light.
   C. Because once light fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and circadian can be ignored without changing conclusions about sleep.
   D. Because light directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding sleep.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | light | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | circadian | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves clock is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that sleep should be read alongside circadian, because light alone does not settle what clock means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: At the center of this timing system sits a small region of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
   A. the idea that These rhythms are not passive reactions to daylight, in the cases described, as the discussion implies.
   B. the idea that They are generated by internal molecular loops and then synchronized, or entrained, to the external day
   C. the idea that Neurons in the SCN contain genes whose products inhibit their own production in a delayed feedback loop, creating an oscillation
   D. the idea that [B] The causal pathway is plausible: hormones that regulate appetite and insulin sensitivity are timed, and repeated disruption can strain the system
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of light lead to different conclusions about sleep.
   B. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of light and clock should be abandoned altogether, especially regarding circadian.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses clock, so debate over light is unnecessary noise, under the stated assumptions.
   D. to show that the term sleep belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
