Passage 0156: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 751)

Despite tidy textbook narratives, researchers found that researchers have treated shifts in
industrial labor demand as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. To be sure, housing record reconstruction can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, yet the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

To be sure, the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, yet the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how racial violence
and intimidation can shift baselines, altering whether shifts in industrial labor demand is
even comparable across cases, which helps explain why means that a good fit is not the same
as a good explanation. Unless racial violence and intimidation is changed while the nominal
driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed
cannot be claimed with confidence. In this sense, african american internal migration is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Seldom, prior to analysts began combining housing record reconstruction with cross-site
comparisons, did investigators concede that claims about the great migration and northern
urban transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which shifts in industrial labor demand
could be explained in more than one way because confounders like racial violence and
intimidation often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
which changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

It is the apparent regularity of shifts in industrial labor demand that drives the first
interpretation: shifts in industrial labor demand is treated as a direct readout of
mechanism. [A] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead to a
different conclusion. If shifts in industrial labor demand is uniquely produced by one
causal pathway, a different prediction follows: then observations from Detroit would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. [B] This is why the author
repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred. the literature is full of such
claims—not the caveat that racial violence and intimidation might reproduce the same
pattern. [C] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid
overclaiming. [D] The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols are
comparable. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from
description to explanation to fail, then the same observation—shifts in industrial labor
demand—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas
popular summaries treat shifts in industrial labor demand as an endpoint, the passage treats
it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

Using housing record reconstruction under stable conditions, one frequently cited case from
Detroit appeared to support the direct-readout view. Though the original fit looked visually
decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in racial violence and
intimidation altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic shifts in industrial labor demand.
the passage treats this episode as diagnostic; this, in turn, illustrates why boundary
conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. In this sense, twentieth-
century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even
though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which shifts in industrial labor demand is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.
   A. housing covenants and policy constraints alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. newspaper archive research as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. political realignment patterns specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The author argues that housing record reconstruction should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where housing record reconstruction constrains housing covenants and policy constraints
   C. The discussion suggests that housing covenants and policy constraints is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The passage implies that Harlem is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. shifts in industrial labor demand
   B. labor market inference from wage series
   C. a list of Olympic medal counts
   D. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like racial violence and intimidation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting oral history synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because political realignment patterns uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that racial violence and intimidation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using oral history synthesis are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats oral history synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss political realignment patterns or racial violence and intimidation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that political realignment patterns is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how racial violence and intimidation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Harlem. Finally, it maintains that tests combining oral history synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **convergent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Whereas popular summaries treat shifts in industrial labor demand as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because wartime industry demand dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like census microdata analysis are needed
   D. coming together

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. it prevents shifts in industrial labor demand from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control wartime industry demand
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if oral history synthesis produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. The passage implies that oral history synthesis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from wartime industry demand is impossible.
   D. Because shifts in industrial labor demand appears, the mechanism must be unique, so wartime industry demand can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

7. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using newspaper archive research.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when racial violence and intimidation can mimic changes in neighborhood composition.
   C. The passage suggests that changes in neighborhood composition is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author treats Philadelphia as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Chicago and everywhere else.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates wartime industry demand.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on oral history synthesis simple.

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In short, the passage treats methodological humility as a strength, not as an admission of ignorance.
