Passage 0548: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 669)

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests researchers have treated school-quality
gradients as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Though spatial autocorrelation analysis can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from
historical redlining did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which spatial autocorrelation analysis constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn,
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. In this sense, spatial stratification in cities is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on path dependence from historical
redlining, the argument reframes the issue so that many early studies framed residential
segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality as a single-mechanism phenomenon.
Whereas those studies emphasized school-quality gradients as a signature is easy to measure,
later work asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ is
harder to interpret without assumptions. The passage argues that this shift mattered for how
evidence from large U.S. metropolitan areas was generalized because local conditions can
change which processes generate school-quality gradients.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The passage emphasizes
boundary conditions instead of treating them as afterthoughts. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same
observation—school-quality gradients—must be paired with tests that change the conditions
under which it appears. [B] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. Whereas popular summaries treat school-quality gradients as an endpoint is
easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. [C] This becomes a pivot
point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. [D] The author implies that replication
is informative only when protocols are comparable. In this sense, segregation-driven
inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Only after analysts began combining spatial autocorrelation analysis with cross-site
comparisons did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about
residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which school-quality gradients could be explained in more than one way
because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining often co-vary with the
driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than
a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in
turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any
story is arbitrary. Although the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is
strong, the result is a framework in which school-quality gradients is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats quasi-experimental policy evaluation as a historical curiosity and does not discuss school-quality gradients or credit market discrimination. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that school-quality gradients is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how credit market discrimination can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from European migrant neighborhoods. Finally, it maintains that tests combining quasi-experimental policy evaluation with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   C. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that credit market discrimination is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using quasi-experimental policy evaluation are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like credit market discrimination make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting quasi-experimental policy evaluation as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

   Sentence to insert: As a result, the most valuable observations are often taken during transitions, when competing mechanisms diverge most clearly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | longitudinal panel data | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | school-quality gradients | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | informational asymmetries in housing search | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. May be muted by other processes
   B. It proves school-quality gradients is unique.
   C. It makes path dependence from historical redlining irrelevant.
   D. Requires careful calibration

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The author argues that longitudinal panel data should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'spatial stratification in cities' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal panel data constrains informational asymmetries in housing search
   D. The passage treats mobility constraints across space as a confounder and informational asymmetries in housing search as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

6. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats large U.S. metropolitan areas as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using mobility tracking with administrative records.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when zoning rules and land-use regulation can mimic mobility constraints across space.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving mobility tracking with administrative records.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in rapidly growing Sun Belt regions and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on audit studies in housing markets simple.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates zoning rules and land-use regulation.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies one mechanism.

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that boundary conditions is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents wealth accumulation gaps from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control credit market discrimination
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if quasi-experimental policy evaluation produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. Because wealth accumulation gaps appears, the mechanism must be unique, so credit market discrimination can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once wealth accumulation gaps is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. quasi-experimental policy evaluation

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **robust** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [B] The author uses the example to separate detection from interpretation.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because credit market discrimination dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   C. strong and reliable
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like longitudinal panel data are needed
