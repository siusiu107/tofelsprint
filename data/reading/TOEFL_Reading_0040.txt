Passage 0040: Fresco Painting, Lime Chemistry, and Why Some Wall Colors Survive Centuries (Art History)
=======================================================================================================
(Word count: 610)

A fresco seems, at first glance, like paint on a wall. Yet its durability—colors that can
survive for centuries in damp churches or sunlit villas—depends on chemistry that unfolds
while the wall is still wet. In true fresco, artists apply pigments suspended in water onto
fresh lime plaster. As the plaster dries, it undergoes carbonation: calcium hydroxide in the
wet plaster reacts with carbon dioxide from the air to form calcium carbonate. The pigment
particles become trapped in this growing mineral matrix, effectively turning the wall
surface into a thin layer of stone colored from within.

The timing is unforgiving. Fresh plaster remains workable for only hours. If the artist
waits too long, the surface dries and carbonation advances, so pigments no longer bond
properly. Artists therefore divide large compositions into daily sections, called giornate,
each small enough to complete before the plaster sets. [A] The seams between giornate can be
subtle, but under raking light they sometimes reveal the schedule of the painter’s labor,
like a calendar embedded in stone.

Not all pigments behave well in the alkaline environment of lime plaster. Some organic
pigments and certain blues and greens can change color or degrade when exposed to high pH.
This constraint shaped artistic choices. Earth pigments—ochres rich in iron oxides—are
stable and were widely used for reds, yellows, and browns. Carbon blacks are also stable,
allowing strong outlines. The brilliant blue associated with Renaissance art often required
expensive minerals such as lapis lazuli or, when unavailable, later synthetic pigments
applied a secco, meaning on dry plaster with a binder. A secco painting can achieve colors
that fresco cannot, but it is generally less durable because the pigment sits on the surface
rather than being locked into the plaster.

Moisture and salt are long-term enemies. Water moving through a wall can dissolve salts and
carry them to the surface. When the water evaporates, salts crystallize, expanding and
exerting pressure that can flake plaster away. The damage can lift the pigment-bearing
layer, producing losses that look like missing skin. [B] In that sense, preservation is not
only about the paint; it is about the wall as a porous system interacting with climate and
masonry.

Conservationists therefore study frescoes as material objects. They analyze plaster
composition, identify pigments, and monitor humidity. Cleaning is delicate because the
mineral matrix can trap dirt as well as pigment, and aggressive solvents can alter surfaces.
In some restorations, consolidants are injected to stabilize fragile layers, but these
materials must be compatible with the original chemistry; otherwise, they can create new
stress or block moisture flow, worsening salt problems. Ethical debates follow. Should
missing sections be repainted to restore visual unity, or should losses remain visible as
historical scars? Different traditions answer differently, but all must respect the physical
limits of the medium.

The fresco technique also influenced style. Because shading must be executed quickly,
artists developed efficient workflows: broad areas of color laid down early, finer details
added while the plaster still accepted pigment. Cartoon drawings were transferred to walls
by pouncing charcoal through perforations, producing dotted outlines that guided painting.
[C] The method shaped the image, reminding us that art history is partly a history of
constraints—how artists compose when chemistry dictates speed.

A fresco endures when its chemistry is allowed to complete and when its environment remains
kind. [D] What the viewer sees as a serene Madonna or a bustling marketplace is also a
record of lime turning to limestone, pigments chosen for alkaline peace, and centuries of
moisture negotiating with stone. To read a fresco fully is therefore to read both an image
and a reaction.

Questions
---------
1. [Vocabulary] The word “carbonation” in the passage refers to:
   A. a reaction in which lime plaster takes up carbon dioxide
   B. a salt crystallization cycle
   C. a process of adding bubbles to paint
   D. a method of making charcoal outlines


2. [Factual] According to the passage, why are large frescoes divided into giornate?
   A. Because the plaster remains workable only for hours, so each day’s section must be finished before it sets.
   B. Because the plaster remains workable only for hours, so each day’s section must be finished before it sets by tying the effect to water.
   C. even though the plaster remains workable only for hours, so each day’s section must be finished before it sets. That would make different the primary constraint.
   D. Because the plaster remains workable only for hours, so each day’s section must be finished before it sets. This would require history to be the limiting factor.


3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: That mineralization is what distinguishes true fresco from paint merely stuck onto a surface.
   A. [C]
   B. [D]
   C. [A]
   D. [B]


4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why some pigments were applied a secco rather than in true fresco?
   A. Some pigments were unstable in alkaline wet plaster, so applying them on dry plaster with a binder preserved their color. That would make moisture the primary constraint.
   B. Some pigments were unstable in alkaline wet plaster, so applying them on dry plaster with a binder preserved their color.
   C. Some pigments were solely unstable in alkaline wet plaster, so applying them on dry plaster with a binder preserved their color. This would occur only when carbonation dominates.
   D. Some pigments were unstable in alkaline wet plaster, so applying them on dry plaster with a binder preserved their color by tying the effect to madonna.


5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as threats to fresco durability EXCEPT:
   A. high alkalinity affecting certain pigments.
   B. magnetic tipping of competing standards.
   C. moisture-driven salt crystallization.
   D. chemical incompatibility of restoration materials.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention ethical debates in conservation?
   A. To show that restoring frescoes involves choices about appearance as well as physical stabilization by tying the effect to cartoon.
   B. To show that restoring frescoes involves choices about appearance as well as physical stabilization.
   C. To show that restoring frescoes involves choices about appearance as well as physical stabilization. That would make centuries the primary constraint.
   D. To show that restoring frescoes involves choices about appearance as well as physical stabilization. This would require chemistry to be the limiting factor.


7. [Reference] In the passage, “this constraint” refers to the fact that:
   A. many pigments are unstable in the alkaline earth of fresh lime plaster. This would require different to be the limiting factor.
   B. many pigments are unstable in the alkaline environment of fresh lime plaster.
   C. many pigments are solely unstable in the alkaline environment of fresh lime plaster. That would make carbon the primary constraint.

   C. It explains fresco chemistry and timing, then discusses pigment compatibility, long-term deterioration mechanisms, conservation challenges, and how technique shapes artistic workflow.
   D. It explains fresco earth and timing, then discusses pigment compatibility, long-term deterioration mechanisms, conservation challenges, and how technique shapes artistic workflow. This outcome would hold even if artists stays constant.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that preservation depends on the wall as “a porous system”?
   A. different and salts move through masonry, so the wall’s material behavior can damage or protect the pigment layer. That would make carbon the primary constraint.
   B. Moisture and salts move through masonry, so the wall’s material behavior must damage or protect the pigment layer. This outcome would hold even if artists stays constant.
   C. Moisture and salts move through masonry, so the wall’s material behavior can damage or protect the pigment layer.
