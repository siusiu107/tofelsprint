Passage 0040: Fresco Painting, Lime Chemistry, and Why Some Wall Colors Survive Centuries (Art History)
=======================================================================================================
(Word count: 610)

A fresco seems, at first glance, like paint on a wall. Yet its durability—colors that can
survive for centuries in damp churches or sunlit villas—depends on chemistry that unfolds
while the wall is still wet. In true fresco, artists apply pigments suspended in water onto
fresh lime plaster. As the plaster dries, it undergoes carbonation: calcium hydroxide in the
wet plaster reacts with carbon dioxide from the air to form calcium carbonate. The pigment
particles become trapped in this growing mineral matrix, effectively turning the wall
surface into a thin layer of stone colored from within.

The timing is unforgiving. Fresh plaster remains workable for only hours. If the artist
waits too long, the surface dries and carbonation advances, so pigments no longer bond
properly. Artists therefore divide large compositions into daily sections, called giornate,
each small enough to complete before the plaster sets. [A] The seams between giornate can be
subtle, but under raking light they sometimes reveal the schedule of the painter’s labor,
like a calendar embedded in stone.

Not all pigments behave well in the alkaline environment of lime plaster. Some organic
pigments and certain blues and greens can change color or degrade when exposed to high pH.
This constraint shaped artistic choices. Earth pigments—ochres rich in iron oxides—are
stable and were widely used for reds, yellows, and browns. Carbon blacks are also stable,
allowing strong outlines. The brilliant blue associated with Renaissance art often required
expensive minerals such as lapis lazuli or, when unavailable, later synthetic pigments
applied a secco, meaning on dry plaster with a binder. A secco painting can achieve colors
that fresco cannot, but it is generally less durable because the pigment sits on the surface
rather than being locked into the plaster.

Moisture and salt are long-term enemies. Water moving through a wall can dissolve salts and
carry them to the surface. When the water evaporates, salts crystallize, expanding and
exerting pressure that can flake plaster away. The damage can lift the pigment-bearing
layer, producing losses that look like missing skin. [B] In that sense, preservation is not
only about the paint; it is about the wall as a porous system interacting with climate and
masonry.

Conservationists therefore study frescoes as material objects. They analyze plaster
composition, identify pigments, and monitor humidity. Cleaning is delicate because the
mineral matrix can trap dirt as well as pigment, and aggressive solvents can alter surfaces.
In some restorations, consolidants are injected to stabilize fragile layers, but these
materials must be compatible with the original chemistry; otherwise, they can create new
stress or block moisture flow, worsening salt problems. Ethical debates follow. Should
missing sections be repainted to restore visual unity, or should losses remain visible as
historical scars? Different traditions answer differently, but all must respect the physical
limits of the medium.

The fresco technique also influenced style. Because shading must be executed quickly,
artists developed efficient workflows: broad areas of color laid down early, finer details
added while the plaster still accepted pigment. Cartoon drawings were transferred to walls
by pouncing charcoal through perforations, producing dotted outlines that guided painting.
[C] The method shaped the image, reminding us that art history is partly a history of
constraints—how artists compose when chemistry dictates speed.

A fresco endures when its chemistry is allowed to complete and when its environment remains
kind. [D] What the viewer sees as a serene Madonna or a bustling marketplace is also a
record of lime turning to limestone, pigments chosen for alkaline peace, and centuries of
moisture negotiating with stone. To read a fresco fully is therefore to read both an image
and a reaction.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] What the viewer sees as a serene Madonna or a bustling marketplace is also a record of lime turning to limestone, pigments chosen for alkaline peace, and centuries of moisture negotiating with stone.
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to pigments and fresco
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of chemistry
   D. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across chemistry

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains plaster by linking pigments to fresco, and it shows why chemistry changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage concedes that pigments is often incomplete and concludes that plaster cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since chemistry overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of fresco with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage surveys plaster but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed fresco first, with pigments serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats chemistry as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   D. The passage presents fresco as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once pigments is observed, competing explanations for plaster collapse. It treats chemistry as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, as the discussion implies.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in chemistry, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of pigments is enough to validate fresco for plaster, in the setting discussed, especially regarding fresco.
   B. The passage treats pigments primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over fresco are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about plaster are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. The passage implies that chemistry mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes pigments effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of fresco no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain plaster, especially regarding chemistry.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how plaster should change if chemistry is altered, instead of assuming that pigments has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to fresco must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of stress corrosion cracking as a factor influencing pigments
   B. discussion of chemistry as a factor influencing pigments
   C. discussion of plaster as a factor influencing pigments
   D. discussion of fresco as a factor influencing pigments, especially regarding plaster.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] What the viewer sees as a serene Madonna or a bustling marketplace is also a record of lime turning to limestone, pigments chosen for alkaline peace, and centuries of moisture negotiating with stone.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, especially regarding artists, especially regarding fresco.
   B. [D] What the viewer sees as a serene Madonna or a bustling marketplace is also a record of lime turning to limestone.
   C. [D] What the viewer sees as a serene Madonna or a bustling marketplace is also a record of lime turning to limestone.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, for the phenomenon at issue, in the cases described.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of fresco guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in chemistry are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because pigments directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding plaster.
   C. Because once pigments fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and chemistry can be ignored without changing conclusions about plaster.
   D. Because comparability prevents fresco from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold chemistry constant while examining pigments.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | pigments | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | chemistry | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It proves fresco is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that plaster should be read alongside chemistry, because pigments alone does not settle what fresco means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: The pigment particles become trapped in this growing mineral matrix, effectively turning the wall surface into a thin layer of stone colored from within.
   A. the idea that Yet its durability—colors that can survive for centuries in damp churches or sunlit villas—depends on chemistry that unfolds while the wall is still wet...
   B. the idea that The timing is unforgiving, under the stated assumptions, as framed by the author, in the cases described.
   C. the idea that As the plaster dries, it undergoes carbonation: calcium hydroxide in the wet plaster reacts with carbon dioxide from the air to form calcium carbonate...
   D. the idea that In true fresco, artists apply pigments suspended in water onto fresh lime plaster, under the stated assumptions.
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of pigments lead to different conclusions about plaster.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses fresco, so debate over pigments is unnecessary noise, especially regarding plaster.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of pigments and fresco should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to show that the term plaster belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, for the phenomenon at issue.
