Passage 0583: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 733)

Against that intuitive story, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated disparate
exposure to pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Even if longitudinal panel data can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Hardly had analysts began combining longitudinal panel data with cross-site comparisons
occurred when claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. [A] The author uses the example to separate detection from interpretation. The
passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate exposure to
pollution could be explained in more than one way because confounders like credit market
discrimination often co-vary with the driver. [B] The passage frames uncertainty as an
ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn,
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. [C] Later comparisons reveal why this
matters. [D] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. In this sense,
spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify credit market discrimination was
the field forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which longitudinal panel data constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why
the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—disparate exposure to pollution—must
be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed
with confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an
endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental
or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. In this sense,
segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike European migrant neighborhoods. The
passage argues that the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying
mechanisms differed because credit market discrimination shifted the baseline in different
directions across sites. Not treating disparate exposure to pollution as a self-sufficient
conclusion, but the author therefore separates detection from interpretation.

Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify credit market discrimination
did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which longitudinal panel data constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Although the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong,
the result is a framework in which disparate exposure to pollution is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when zoning rules and land-use regulation can mimic school-quality gradients.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away zoning rules and land-use regulation, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The author treats European migrant neighborhoods as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   D. The passage suggests that school-quality gradients is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. quasi-experimental policy evaluation
   B. a recipe for bread fermentation
   C. school-quality gradients
   D. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates zoning rules and land-use regulation.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on mobility tracking with administrative records simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in rapidly growing Sun Belt regions and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies one mechanism.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | audit studies in housing markets | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | disparate exposure to pollution | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | zoning rules and land-use regulation | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   B. It proves wealth accumulation gaps is unique.
   C. May be muted by other processes
   D. It replaces audit studies in housing markets with intuition.

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Against that intuitive story, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated disparate exposure to pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   A. quasi-experimental policy evaluation as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. informational asymmetries in housing search alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. wealth accumulation gaps specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. Because informational asymmetries in housing search co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents mobility constraints across space from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control informational asymmetries in housing search
   C. Since mobility constraints across space is observed in post-industrial cities, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because mobility constraints across space appears, the mechanism must be unique, so informational asymmetries in housing search can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats audit studies in housing markets as a historical curiosity and does not discuss wealth accumulation gaps or path dependence from historical redlining. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting audit studies in housing markets as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because wealth accumulation gaps uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that path dependence from historical redlining is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using audit studies in housing markets are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that wealth accumulation gaps is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how path dependence from historical redlining can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from European migrant neighborhoods. Finally, it maintains that tests combining audit studies in housing markets with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where mobility tracking with administrative records constrains path dependence from historical redlining
   B. The passage treats school-quality gradients as a confounder and path dependence from historical redlining as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The passage implies that rapidly growing Sun Belt regions is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'spatial stratification in cities' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **subtle** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate exposure to pollution could be explained in more than one way because confounders like credit market discrimination often co-vary with the driver.
   A. slight
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like quasi-experimental policy evaluation are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because path dependence from historical redlining dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
