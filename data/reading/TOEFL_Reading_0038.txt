Passage 0038: From Miasma to Microbes—How Practical Problems Drove Germ Theory (History of Science)
===================================================================================================
(Word count: 601)

In the mid‑nineteenth century, many Europeans believed that decay and disease arose from
“miasma,” a vague corruption of air associated with filth and odor. The belief was not
foolish; foul-smelling places often were unhealthy. Yet the causal agent was misidentified.
A different view—germ theory—proposed that specific microorganisms could drive fermentation
and infection. The shift from miasma to microbes did not happen because one clever argument
defeated another in a lecture hall. It happened because a series of practical problems
forced increasingly specific explanations.

Fermentation was one such problem. Brewers and winemakers faced batches that soured
unpredictably, threatening livelihoods. Louis Pasteur studied these failures and showed that
different microscopic organisms corresponded to different outcomes. Certain yeasts produced
alcohol; other microbes produced lactic acid or spoiled flavors. If fermentation were purely
chemical, such consistent associations would be hard to explain. Pasteur’s experiments
indicated that life—tiny living agents—was shaping the process. [A] Once fermentation was
linked to organisms, it became plausible that other biological processes, including disease,
might also be driven by specific living invaders.

The next step was control. Pasteur found that heating wine or milk to a moderate temperature
for a brief period could reduce spoilage without destroying flavor. The method, later called
pasteurization, worked because many spoilage organisms and their enzymes were sensitive to
heat. Importantly, the heating was not meant to “purify” air; it targeted organisms in the
liquid itself. When dairies adopted pasteurization, milk became safer and more stable,
reducing risks of tuberculosis and other infections transmitted through contaminated milk.

Skepticism persisted. Some physicians accepted that microbes existed but doubted that they
were primary causes of disease. They argued that microbes might be opportunists that grew
only after tissues were already diseased. The dispute demanded criteria for causation.
Robert Koch supplied a framework by isolating microbes, growing them in pure culture,
introducing them into healthy hosts, and recovering them again. These steps did not resolve
every disease—viruses were still unknown, and some diseases have multiple causes—but they
provided a disciplined way to link a specific microbe to a specific pathology. [B] The
argument moved from general atmosphere to specific agents because only specific agents could
be tested and controlled.

Public health outcomes reinforced the transition. Sanitation remained valuable, but its
value could be reinterpreted. Cleaning streets and improving water supplies reduced disease
not because they removed “bad air” but because they reduced microbial contamination.
Hospitals changed practices as well. Antiseptic surgery, promoted by Joseph Lister, reduced
infection by killing microbes on instruments and wounds. The dramatic drop in postoperative
deaths was difficult to dismiss as coincidence. In effect, the hospital became a laboratory
where microbial hypotheses could be evaluated in the most consequential way.

The germ-theory revolution also altered social behavior. People began boiling instruments,
sterilizing linens, and, later, vaccinating. Each practice required an imaginative leap:
harm could come from entities too small to see. Yet once that leap was made, new causal
chains became visible. A contaminated hand could transmit microbes; a microbe could
multiply; a multiplying microbe could inflame tissue; inflamed tissue could kill. [C] The
chain was granular, and because it was granular, it offered points for intervention.

By the early twentieth century, germ theory had become a foundation for medicine and
industry. Pasteurization, once a technical trick for wine, became a public health standard.
[D] The broader lesson is that scientific revolutions often advance by solving concrete
problems: a sour barrel, a fevered patient, a cluster of surgical deaths. When solutions
require specificity, theories that name specific causes tend to outcompete theories that
rely on diffuse atmospheres.


Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] The word “opportunists” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. agents that take advantage of conditions created by something else
   B. people who brew wine for profit
   C. heat-resistant microbes
   D. hospital instruments

2. [Factual] According to the passage, why did pasteurization reduce spoilage in milk and wine?
   A. Moderate heating killed or disabled many spoilage organisms in the liquid
   B. It removed miasma from the surrounding air
   C. It increased the amount of yeast permanently
   D. It converted lactic acid into alcohol chemically

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The microscope, in that sense, did not merely reveal organisms; it made new explanations actionable.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why a “disciplined way” to link microbes to disease was important?
   A. It allowed debates about causation to be settled with reproducible tests rather than with vague interpretations
   B. It proved that sanitation had no value
   C. It showed that viruses were the main cause of all disease
   D. It eliminated the need for hospitals

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as reinforcing germ theory EXCEPT:
   A. changes in brewing and dairy practices
   B. Koch’s culturing framework
   C. antiseptic surgery outcomes
   D. thermohaline circulation monitoring

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention Lister’s antiseptic surgery?
   A. To provide a high-stakes example where killing microbes reduced deaths, supporting germ-based explanations
   B. To show that heat was unnecessary for milk safety
   C. To argue that microbes are harmless in wounds
   D. To claim that hospitals caused miasma

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the dispute” refers to disagreement over whether microbes:
   A. cause disease or merely grow after tissues are already diseased
   B. exist at all under microscopes
   C. can ferment wine into alcohol
   D. can be killed by any temperature

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It contrasts miasma with germ theory, then follows practical problems and interventions—fermentation, pasteurization, causation tests, and antisepsis—that made specific microbial explanations persuasive
   B. It lists famous scientists without describing their work
   C. It argues that revolutions occur only through speeches
   D. It discusses only sanitation and ignores microbes

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that germ theory offered “points for intervention”?
   A. By identifying specific steps in transmission and growth, it suggested concrete actions to interrupt infection
   B. It replaced all hygiene with prayer
   C. It claimed that disease arises only from smell
   D. It made treatment impossible because microbes are invisible

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Miasma theory was replaced solely because microscopes became cheaper.
   B. The passage explains that germ theory displaced miasma explanations through problem-driven evidence: microbes were linked to fermentation outcomes, controlled through pasteurization, tied to specific diseases via culture-based criteria, and supported by public health and surgical practices that reduced infection by targeting microorganisms.
   C. Pasteurization was invented to remove bad air from hospitals.
   D. Koch’s criteria proved that all diseases have a single microbial cause.
