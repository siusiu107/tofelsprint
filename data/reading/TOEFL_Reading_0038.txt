Passage 0038: From Miasma to Microbes—How Practical Problems Drove Germ Theory (History of Science)
===================================================================================================
(Word count: 601)

In the mid‑nineteenth century, many Europeans believed that decay and disease arose from
“miasma,” a vague corruption of air associated with filth and odor. The belief was not
foolish; foul-smelling places often were unhealthy. Yet the causal agent was misidentified.
A different view—germ theory—proposed that specific microorganisms could drive fermentation
and infection. The shift from miasma to microbes did not happen because one clever argument
defeated another in a lecture hall. It happened because a series of practical problems
forced increasingly specific explanations.

Fermentation was one such problem. Brewers and winemakers faced batches that soured
unpredictably, threatening livelihoods. Louis Pasteur studied these failures and showed that
different microscopic organisms corresponded to different outcomes. Certain yeasts produced
alcohol; other microbes produced lactic acid or spoiled flavors. If fermentation were purely
chemical, such consistent associations would be hard to explain. Pasteur’s experiments
indicated that life—tiny living agents—was shaping the process. [A] Once fermentation was
linked to organisms, it became plausible that other biological processes, including disease,
might also be driven by specific living invaders.

The next step was control. Pasteur found that heating wine or milk to a moderate temperature
for a brief period could reduce spoilage without destroying flavor. The method, later called
pasteurization, worked because many spoilage organisms and their enzymes were sensitive to
heat. Importantly, the heating was not meant to “purify” air; it targeted organisms in the
liquid itself. When dairies adopted pasteurization, milk became safer and more stable,
reducing risks of tuberculosis and other infections transmitted through contaminated milk.

Skepticism persisted. Some physicians accepted that microbes existed but doubted that they
were primary causes of disease. They argued that microbes might be opportunists that grew
only after tissues were already diseased. The dispute demanded criteria for causation.
Robert Koch supplied a framework by isolating microbes, growing them in pure culture,
introducing them into healthy hosts, and recovering them again. These steps did not resolve
every disease—viruses were still unknown, and some diseases have multiple causes—but they
provided a disciplined way to link a specific microbe to a specific pathology. [B] The
argument moved from general atmosphere to specific agents because only specific agents could
be tested and controlled.

Public health outcomes reinforced the transition. Sanitation remained valuable, but its
value could be reinterpreted. Cleaning streets and improving water supplies reduced disease
not because they removed “bad air” but because they reduced microbial contamination.
Hospitals changed practices as well. Antiseptic surgery, promoted by Joseph Lister, reduced
infection by killing microbes on instruments and wounds. The dramatic drop in postoperative
deaths was difficult to dismiss as coincidence. In effect, the hospital became a laboratory
where microbial hypotheses could be evaluated in the most consequential way.

The germ-theory revolution also altered social behavior. People began boiling instruments,
sterilizing linens, and, later, vaccinating. Each practice required an imaginative leap:
harm could come from entities too small to see. Yet once that leap was made, new causal
chains became visible. A contaminated hand could transmit microbes; a microbe could
multiply; a multiplying microbe could inflame tissue; inflamed tissue could kill. [C] The
chain was granular, and because it was granular, it offered points for intervention.

By the early twentieth century, germ theory had become a foundation for medicine and
industry. Pasteurization, once a technical trick for wine, became a public health standard.
[D] The broader lesson is that scientific revolutions often advance by solving concrete
problems: a sour barrel, a fevered patient, a cluster of surgical deaths. When solutions
require specificity, theories that name specific causes tend to outcompete theories that
rely on diffuse atmospheres.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: These steps did not resolve every disease—viruses were still unknown, and some diseases have multiple causes—but they provided a disciplined way to link a specific microbe to a specific pathology.
   A. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of became
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to microbes and disease
   C. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across became
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents disease as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once microbes is observed, competing explanations for specific collapse. It treats became as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding became.
   B. The passage concedes that microbes is often incomplete and concludes that specific cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since became overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of disease with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage explains specific by linking microbes to disease, and it shows why became changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage surveys specific but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed disease first, with microbes serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats became as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in became, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of microbes is enough to validate disease for specific.
   B. The passage implies that became mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes microbes effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of disease no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain specific, within the passage’s scope.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how specific should change if became is altered, instead of assuming that microbes has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to disease must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage treats microbes primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over disease are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about specific are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, in the examples provided, for the main claim of the text.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of specific as a factor influencing microbes, given the evidence cited.
   B. discussion of disease as a factor influencing microbes
   C. discussion of became as a factor influencing microbes
   D. discussion of sediment provenance as a factor influencing microbes

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: These steps did not resolve every disease—viruses were still unknown, and some diseases have multiple causes—but they provided a disciplined way to link a specific microbe to a specific pathology.
   A. These steps did not resolve every disease—viruses were still unknown. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. These steps did not resolve every disease—viruses were still unknown. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding microbes.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because microbes directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding specific.
   B. Because once microbes fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and became can be ignored without changing conclusions about specific.
   C. Because the presence of disease guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in became are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because comparability prevents disease from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold became constant while examining microbes.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | microbes | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | became | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It proves disease is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that specific should be read alongside became, because microbes alone does not settle what disease means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "these" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Louis Pasteur studied these failures and showed that different microscopic organisms corresponded to different outcomes.
   A. the idea that Antiseptic surgery, promoted by Joseph Lister, reduced infection by killing microbes on instruments and wounds
   B. the idea that Certain yeasts produced alcohol; other microbes produced lactic acid or spoiled flavors
   C. the idea that Fermentation was one such problem, in the setting discussed, as framed by the author.
   D. the idea that Brewers and winemakers faced batches that soured unpredictably, threatening livelihoods
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of microbes lead to different conclusions about specific.
   B. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of microbes and disease should be abandoned altogether, especially regarding specific.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses disease, so debate over microbes is unnecessary noise, given the evidence cited.
   D. to show that the term specific belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
