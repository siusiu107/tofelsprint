Passage 0341: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 733)

Under multi-epoch monitoring, researchers have treated rotation-modulated light curves as
the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy. Even if simultaneous
photometric monitoring can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that
such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting
debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for; this, in
turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation,
a different prediction follows: then the same observation—rotation-modulated light
curves—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas
popular summaries treat rotation-modulated light curves as an endpoint is easy to measure,
the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. In this sense, unocculted spot/facula
bias in transit data is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify starspot
temperature contrasts. by comparing cases in which simultaneous photometric monitoring
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, a
move that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. While it
is true that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify starspot temperature contrasts
did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] The passage
highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. by comparing cases in
which simultaneous photometric monitoring constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, a move that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] Later comparisons reveal why this matters.
Though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] The author uses the detour
to show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. [D] The author suggests
that the same evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ. In this sense,
activity-driven spectral distortion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label.

In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike M-dwarf systems with repeated transits. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because
starspot temperature contrasts shifted the baseline in different directions across sites,
which is why replication matters. the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation, not because treating rotation-modulated light curves as a self-sufficient
conclusion, but because the assumptions differ.

Only after analysts began combining simultaneous photometric monitoring with cross-site
comparisons did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about stellar
contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying on a single figure and started relying
on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which rotation-modulated
light curves could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like
starspot temperature contrasts often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an
outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense,
photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. To be
sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, yet the result
is a framework in which rotation-modulated light curves is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because spurious molecular detections uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that starspot temperature contrasts is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using chromatic transit analysis are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats chromatic transit analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss spurious molecular detections or starspot temperature contrasts. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that spurious molecular detections is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how starspot temperature contrasts can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from multi-epoch JWST targets. Finally, it maintains that tests combining chromatic transit analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   D. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like starspot temperature contrasts make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting chromatic transit analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy
   B. apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering
   C. simultaneous photometric monitoring
   D. the length of the Nile in miles

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **robust** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict.
   A. strong and reliable
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like simultaneous photometric monitoring are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because starspot temperature contrasts dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail

4. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that Gaussian-process detrending directly measures causes, meaning confounding from instrument drift across visits is impossible.
   B. it prevents rotation-modulated light curves from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control instrument drift across visits
   C. Since rotation-modulated light curves is observed in multi-epoch JWST targets, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because instrument drift across visits co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: If one wishes to move from description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—rotation-modulated light curves—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. starspot temperature contrasts alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. simultaneous photometric monitoring as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. spurious molecular detections specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where multi-epoch transit campaigns constrains limb-darkening model mismatch
   B. The passage implies that active K-dwarf host stars is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The discussion suggests that limb-darkening model mismatch is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The author argues that multi-epoch transit campaigns should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

8. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage suggests that apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving simultaneous photometric monitoring.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away facula coverage fractions, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facula coverage fractions can mimic apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering.
