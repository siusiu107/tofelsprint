Passage 0764: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 745)

Across multiple northern cities, one sees why researchers have treated segregation and
redlining signatures as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. Even though census microdata analysis can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using census microdata analysis under stable conditions, the key question becomes whether
one frequently cited case from Philadelphia appeared to support the direct-readout view.
Despite the fact that the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis
showed that small shifts in racial violence and intimidation altered the baseline enough to
mute or mimic segregation and redlining signatures. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, which helps explain why illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted. In this sense, african american internal migration is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—segregation and
redlining signatures—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat segregation and redlining signatures as an endpoint
may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is scientifically revealing.

Only through analysts began combining census microdata analysis with cross-site comparisons
could one reasonably claim that claims about the great migration and northern urban
transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which segregation and redlining
signatures could be explained in more than one way because confounders like racial violence
and intimidation often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense,
south-to-north population movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify racial violence and
intimidation, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather
than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which census microdata analysis constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, a move that is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single
case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on racial violence and intimidation, the
passage suggests many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban
transformation as a single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] The discussion makes clear that
measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. Whereas those studies emphasized
segregation and redlining signatures as a signature may be convenient, later work asked
whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ is scientifically
revealing. [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test. The
passage argues that this shift mattered for how evidence from Philadelphia was generalized
because local conditions can change which processes generate segregation and redlining
signatures. [C] The argument hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation.
[D] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence. In this sense,
twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Although the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is
a framework in which segregation and redlining signatures is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Detroit and everywhere else.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates housing covenants and policy constraints.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on housing record reconstruction simple.

2. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away push–pull dynamics, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when push–pull dynamics can mimic changes in neighborhood composition.
   C. The passage suggests that changes in neighborhood composition is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving labor market inference from wage series.

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The author emphasizes that a clean-looking curve can still encode hidden choices, especially when preprocessing is treated as neutral.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like housing covenants and policy constraints make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting newspaper archive research as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats newspaper archive research as a historical curiosity and does not discuss political realignment patterns or housing covenants and policy constraints. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that political realignment patterns is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how housing covenants and policy constraints can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Chicago. Finally, it maintains that tests combining newspaper archive research with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   D. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because political realignment patterns uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that housing covenants and policy constraints is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using newspaper archive research are unnecessary.

5. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that housing record reconstruction directly measures causes, meaning confounding from push–pull dynamics is impossible.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if housing record reconstruction produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. Because push–pull dynamics co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. it prevents changes in neighborhood composition from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control push–pull dynamics

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where labor market inference from wage series constrains wartime industry demand
   B. The passage implies that Chicago is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The discussion suggests that wartime industry demand is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'African American internal migration' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.

7. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. census microdata analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. political realignment patterns specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. housing covenants and policy constraints alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

8. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **degenerate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify racial violence and intimidation, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
   A. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   B. not uniquely determined
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because push–pull dynamics dominates all evidence
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like census microdata analysis are needed
