Passage 0579: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 766)

In twentieth-century urban histories, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated
changes in neighborhood composition as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern
urban transformation. Even if newspaper archive research can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Using newspaper archive
research under stable conditions, the interpretation shifts, and one frequently cited case
from Chicago appeared to support the direct-readout view. [A] The passage frames uncertainty
as an ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment. Though the original fit
looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in wartime
industry demand altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic changes in neighborhood
composition. [B] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is
inferred. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, an outcome that illustrates why
boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. [C] The author
notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. [D] That point is
not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows. In this sense, african american
internal migration is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify wartime industry demand did
the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases
in which newspaper archive research constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Even if a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. If
anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage presents
as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—changes in neighborhood
composition—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears
cannot be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat changes in neighborhood
composition as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point
for sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated.
Working with sparse records and limited controls on wartime industry demand, the passage
suggests many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban transformation as
a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized changes in neighborhood
composition as a signature is easy to measure, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ is harder to interpret without assumptions.
this shift mattered for how evidence from Chicago was generalized because local conditions
can change which processes generate changes in neighborhood composition. In this sense,
south-to-north population movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label. Rarely, unless analysts began combining newspaper archive research with cross-
site comparisons, does one see why claims about the great migration and northern urban
transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which changes in neighborhood composition
could be explained in more than one way because confounders like wartime industry demand
often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an
outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. Only by analysts began
combining newspaper archive research with cross-site comparisons was the field forced to
accept that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which changes in neighborhood composition could be explained in more
than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like wartime industry demand often
co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, one sees why the passage
concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing
assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.
   A. oral history synthesis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. racial violence and intimidation alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. changes in neighborhood composition specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

2. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. it prevents shifts in industrial labor demand from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control push–pull dynamics
   B. Since shifts in industrial labor demand is observed in Harlem, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifts in industrial labor demand is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if oral history synthesis produces a tight fit on one dataset.

3. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when racial violence and intimidation can mimic shifts in industrial labor demand.
   B. The author treats Chicago as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving oral history synthesis.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away racial violence and intimidation, since variability is merely a measurement error.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   B. the length of the Nile in miles
   C. changes in neighborhood composition
   D. oral history synthesis

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that racial violence and intimidation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using census microdata analysis are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats census microdata analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifts in industrial labor demand or racial violence and intimidation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like racial violence and intimidation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting census microdata analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that shifts in industrial labor demand is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how racial violence and intimidation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Chicago. Finally, it maintains that tests combining census microdata analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: Only by analysts began combining newspaper archive research with cross-site comparisons was the field forced to accept that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates housing covenants and policy constraints.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Chicago and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on census microdata analysis simple.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because changes in neighborhood composition uniquely identifies one mechanism.

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **subtle** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like newspaper archive research are needed
   B. slight
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because push–pull dynamics dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The discussion suggests that push–pull dynamics is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The passage treats changes in neighborhood composition as a confounder and push–pull dynamics as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where labor market inference from wage series constrains push–pull dynamics
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'South-to-North population movement' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
