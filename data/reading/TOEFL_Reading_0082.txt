Passage 0082: Honeybee Castes, Royal Jelly, and Epigenetic Pathways to Queens and Workers (Biology)
===================================================================================================
(Word count: 606)

A honeybee colony presents an evolutionary puzzle that is also a developmental one: queens
and workers share the same genome, yet they emerge as adults with radically different
bodies, lifespans, and reproductive capacities. The queen can live for years and lay
thousands of eggs, whereas workers typically live weeks and, despite doing nearly all
foraging and nursing, do not reproduce. Because the genetic blueprint is shared, the
divergence must be built by regulation—by when and how genes are turned on, and by how
nutrition and hormones steer that regulation.

The decisive fork begins in the larval diet. Larvae destined to become queens receive
abundant royal jelly throughout early development, while worker-destined larvae receive
royal jelly briefly and then shift to a diet containing more pollen and honey. The
difference is not only caloric; it is biochemical. Royal jelly contains proteins such as
royalactin and distinct fatty acids that influence signaling pathways. [A] Through these
pathways, diet shapes hormone levels, especially juvenile hormone, which affects growth rate
and organ development.

One of the most studied molecular levers in caste differentiation is DNA methylation. In
many animals, methyl groups can be added to cytosine bases in DNA, often reducing gene
expression by altering chromatin structure or by affecting transcription factor binding.
Honeybees have an active methylation system, and experiments in which the DNA
methyltransferase gene is knocked down can cause worker-destined larvae to develop queen-
like traits. This result suggests that methylation patterns help lock in worker development,
not by rewriting genes, but by changing which genetic instructions are accessible. [B] The
genome is the same text, yet the colony edits which chapters are read.

Caste differences extend beyond ovaries. Queens have a larger abdomen, different pheromone-
producing glands, and a distinct metabolic profile. Workers develop specialized structures
for tasks, such as pollen baskets on their hind legs and glands that produce wax. Behavioral
differences also arise. Workers transition through a sequence of roles—nurse, builder,
guard, forager— and these shifts are accompanied by changes in gene expression in the brain.
Nutrition and social cues, such as pheromones from the queen and brood, modulate these
transitions, indicating that plasticity persists beyond larval development.

Because the system is plastic, it also has vulnerabilities. Environmental contaminants that
mimic hormones can disrupt developmental timing. Nutritional stress can skew caste ratios,
especially when colonies are recovering from disease or habitat loss. Meanwhile, beekeepers
sometimes exploit plasticity by rearing queens deliberately, selecting larvae and feeding
them intensively. The practice illustrates that caste is not a mystical essence; it is a
developmental trajectory that can be pushed, within limits, by inputs.

For evolutionary biologists, the broader interest is how such plasticity can be stable. A
colony benefits from producing reproductive queens only when needed, yet it benefits from
producing many workers continuously. Selection therefore favors a system in which queen
development is costly and conditional. Royal jelly becomes both nourishment and a
gatekeeping signal: it indicates that the colony’s social and nutritional context can afford
a queen. [C] In that way, a larval diet is not simply food; it is information about the
colony.

Honeybee caste determination, then, is an example of how environment can sculpt phenotype
without changing genotype. [D] It demonstrates that inheritance is not only about DNA
sequence, but also about regulatory mechanisms—epigenetic marks, hormones, and social
signals—that translate a shared genome into a division of labor.

Intriguingly, the same larval genome can yield different adult bodies, which is why
honeybees became a showcase for developmental plasticity.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: A honeybee colony presents an evolutionary puzzle that is also a developmental one: queens and workers share the same genome, yet they emerge as adults with radically different bodies, lifespans, and reproductive capacities.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across workers
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to developmental and queens
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of workers
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains colony by linking developmental to queens, and it shows why workers changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage concedes that developmental is often incomplete and concludes that colony cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since workers overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of queens with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, especially regarding queens.
   C. The passage surveys colony but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed queens first, with developmental serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats workers as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   D. The passage presents queens as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once developmental is observed, competing explanations for colony collapse. It treats workers as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in workers, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of developmental is enough to validate queens for colony.
   B. The passage treats developmental primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over queens are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about colony are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, especially regarding genome, especially regarding developmental.
   C. The passage implies that workers mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes developmental effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of queens no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain colony, especially regarding queens.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how colony should change if workers is altered, instead of assuming that developmental has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to queens must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of calibration drift as a factor influencing developmental
   B. discussion of colony as a factor influencing developmental
   C. discussion of queens as a factor influencing developmental, especially regarding developmental.
   D. discussion of workers as a factor influencing developmental

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: A honeybee colony presents an evolutionary puzzle that is also a developmental one: queens and workers share the same genome, yet they emerge as adults with radically different bodies, lifespans, and reproductive capacities.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding developmental, in the cases described.
   B. A honeybee colony presents an evolutionary puzzle that is also a developmental one: queens and workers share the same genome. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. A honeybee colony presents an evolutionary puzzle that is also a developmental one: queens and workers share the same genome. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, under the stated assumptions.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of queens guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in workers are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because comparability prevents queens from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold workers constant while examining developmental.
   C. Because developmental directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding colony.
   D. Because once developmental fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and workers can be ignored without changing conclusions about colony.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | developmental | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | workers | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It proves queens is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that colony should be read alongside workers, because developmental alone does not settle what queens means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This result suggests that methylation patterns help lock in worker development, not by rewriting genes, but by changing which genetic instructions are accessible.
   A. the idea that [B] The genome is the same text, yet the colony edits which chapters are read, in the cases described.
   B. the idea that Honeybees have an active methylation system, and experiments in which the DNA methyltransferase gene is knocked down can cause worker-destined larvae to develop queen-...
   C. the idea that Royal jelly contains proteins such as royalactin and distinct fatty acids that influence signaling pathways, for the phenomenon at issue.
   D. the idea that In many animals, methyl groups can be added to cytosine bases in DNA, often reducing gene expression by altering chromatin structure or by affecting...
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses queens, so debate over developmental is unnecessary noise, for the main claim of the text.
   B. to show that the term colony belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of developmental and queens should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of developmental lead to different conclusions about colony.
