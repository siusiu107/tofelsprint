Passage 0082: Honeybee Castes, Royal Jelly, and Epigenetic Pathways to Queens and Workers (Biology)
===================================================================================================
(Word count: 606)

A honeybee colony presents an evolutionary puzzle that is also a developmental one: queens
and workers share the same genome, yet they emerge as adults with radically different
bodies, lifespans, and reproductive capacities. The queen can live for years and lay
thousands of eggs, whereas workers typically live weeks and, despite doing nearly all
foraging and nursing, do not reproduce. Because the genetic blueprint is shared, the
divergence must be built by regulation—by when and how genes are turned on, and by how
nutrition and hormones steer that regulation.

The decisive fork begins in the larval diet. Larvae destined to become queens receive
abundant royal jelly throughout early development, while worker-destined larvae receive
royal jelly briefly and then shift to a diet containing more pollen and honey. The
difference is not only caloric; it is biochemical. Royal jelly contains proteins such as
royalactin and distinct fatty acids that influence signaling pathways. [A] Through these
pathways, diet shapes hormone levels, especially juvenile hormone, which affects growth rate
and organ development.

One of the most studied molecular levers in caste differentiation is DNA methylation. In
many animals, methyl groups can be added to cytosine bases in DNA, often reducing gene
expression by altering chromatin structure or by affecting transcription factor binding.
Honeybees have an active methylation system, and experiments in which the DNA
methyltransferase gene is knocked down can cause worker-destined larvae to develop queen-
like traits. This result suggests that methylation patterns help lock in worker development,
not by rewriting genes, but by changing which genetic instructions are accessible. [B] The
genome is the same text, yet the colony edits which chapters are read.

Caste differences extend beyond ovaries. Queens have a larger abdomen, different pheromone-
producing glands, and a distinct metabolic profile. Workers develop specialized structures
for tasks, such as pollen baskets on their hind legs and glands that produce wax. Behavioral
differences also arise. Workers transition through a sequence of roles—nurse, builder,
guard, forager— and these shifts are accompanied by changes in gene expression in the brain.
Nutrition and social cues, such as pheromones from the queen and brood, modulate these
transitions, indicating that plasticity persists beyond larval development.

Because the system is plastic, it also has vulnerabilities. Environmental contaminants that
mimic hormones can disrupt developmental timing. Nutritional stress can skew caste ratios,
especially when colonies are recovering from disease or habitat loss. Meanwhile, beekeepers
sometimes exploit plasticity by rearing queens deliberately, selecting larvae and feeding
them intensively. The practice illustrates that caste is not a mystical essence; it is a
developmental trajectory that can be pushed, within limits, by inputs.

For evolutionary biologists, the broader interest is how such plasticity can be stable. A
colony benefits from producing reproductive queens only when needed, yet it benefits from
producing many workers continuously. Selection therefore favors a system in which queen
development is costly and conditional. Royal jelly becomes both nourishment and a
gatekeeping signal: it indicates that the colony’s social and nutritional context can afford
a queen. [C] In that way, a larval diet is not simply food; it is information about the
colony.

Honeybee caste determination, then, is an example of how environment can sculpt phenotype
without changing genotype. [D] It demonstrates that inheritance is not only about DNA
sequence, but also about regulatory mechanisms—epigenetic marks, hormones, and social
signals—that translate a shared genome into a division of labor.

Intriguingly, the same larval genome can yield different adult bodies, which is why
honeybees became a showcase for developmental plasticity.

Questions
---------
1. [Vocabulary] The word “trajectory” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a pheromone released only by workers
   B. a container used to store honey
   C. a developmental path that unfolds over time
   D. a genetic mutation in DNA sequence


2. [Factual] According to the passage, what early-life factor most directly initiates queen versus worker development?
   A. differences in larval diet, including prolonged royal jelly feeding for castes. That would make castes the primary constraint.
   B. differences in larval diet, including prolonged royal jelly feeding for queens. That would make differences the primary constraint.
   C. differences in larval diet, including prolonged royal jelly feeding for queens.
   D. differences in larval diet, including prolonged royal jelly feeding for queens. This would occur only when caste dominates.


3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This is why nutrition can have long-lasting consequences even when the DNA sequence remains unchanged.
   A. [B]
   B. [A]
   C. [D]
   D. [C]


4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why the author calls royal jelly a “gatekeeping signal”?
   A. It helps ensure that queen expression occurs mainly when the colony’s conditions can support the cost of producing a reproductive individual. That would make workers the primary constraint.
   B. It helps ensure that queen development occurs mainly when the colony’s conditions can solely support the cost of producing a reproductive individual. This outcome would hold even if castes stays constant.
   C. It helps ensure that queen development occurs mainly when the colony’s conditions must support the cost of producing a reproductive individual. This would occur only when honeybees dominates.
   D. It helps ensure that queen development occurs mainly when the colony’s conditions can support the cost of producing a reproductive individual.


5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss experiments that knock down a DNA methyltransferase gene?
   A. To provide evidence that methylation patterns influence whether larvae develop worker- or queen-like traits. This would require queens to be the limiting factor.
   B. To provide evidence that methylation patterns influence whether larvae develop worker- or queen-like traits.
   C. To provide evidence that methylation patterns influence whether selection develop worker- or queen-like traits. This outcome would hold even if selection stays constant.
