Passage 0516: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 722)

Across multiple northern cities, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated changes
in neighborhood composition as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. oral history synthesis can make the pattern look unusually sharp; still, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than
rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were
applied in settings unlike Philadelphia. the same summary statistic could be reproduced
while the underlying mechanisms differed in part because housing covenants and policy
constraints shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. the author therefore
separates detection from interpretation—not treating changes in neighborhood composition as
a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, african american internal migration is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify housing covenants and policy
constraints did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] This is why the author repeatedly
contrasts what is measured with what is inferred. by comparing cases in which oral history
synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B]
The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence. Admittedly, a single
case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative. [C] This point forces the reader to
consider how confounders enter the pipeline. [D] The passage frames uncertainty as an
ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move
from description to explanation, then the same observation—changes in neighborhood
composition—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat changes in neighborhood composition as an endpoint, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.
In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from
description to explanation to fail, then the same observation—changes in neighborhood
composition—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat changes in neighborhood composition as an endpoint in one
account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts in another.

It is the apparent regularity of changes in neighborhood composition that drives the first
interpretation: changes in neighborhood composition is treated as a direct readout of
mechanism. If changes in neighborhood composition is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway, a different prediction follows: then observations from Philadelphia would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. The issue is not the caveat that
housing covenants and policy constraints might reproduce the same pattern; it is that the
literature is full of such claims. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about the great
migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record
can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Despite the fact
that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which changes in neighborhood composition is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'mass relocation from the Jim Crow South' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   B. The passage implies that Chicago is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author argues that oral history synthesis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where oral history synthesis constrains racial violence and intimidation

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Chicago and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on labor market inference from wage series simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because segregation and redlining signatures uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates push–pull dynamics.

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.
   A. housing record reconstruction as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. political realignment patterns specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. wartime industry demand alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In short, the passage treats methodological humility as a strength, not as an admission of ignorance.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. newspaper archive research
   B. a recipe for bread fermentation
   C. shifts in industrial labor demand
   D. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize confounder control?
   A. it prevents changes in neighborhood composition from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control housing covenants and policy constraints
   B. Because housing covenants and policy constraints co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. The passage implies that labor market inference from wage series directly measures causes, meaning confounding from housing covenants and policy constraints is impossible.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if labor market inference from wage series produces a tight fit on one dataset.

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conspicuous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: by comparing cases in which oral history synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
   A. easy to notice
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because housing covenants and policy constraints dominates all evidence
   C. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like labor market inference from wage series are needed

8. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | housing record reconstruction | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | shifts in industrial labor demand | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | housing covenants and policy constraints | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. May not generalize across contexts
   B. Can mimic the target feature

   D. Can be contaminated by background variability

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that wartime industry demand is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using newspaper archive research are unnecessary.
   B. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that shifts in industrial labor demand is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how wartime industry demand can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Chicago. Finally, it maintains that tests combining newspaper archive research with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   C. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like wartime industry demand make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting newspaper archive research as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats newspaper archive research as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifts in industrial labor demand or wartime industry demand. It ends without any methodological implication.

10. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away wartime industry demand, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when wartime industry demand can mimic segregation and redlining signatures.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving census microdata analysis.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using census microdata analysis.
