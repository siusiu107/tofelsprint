Passage 0041: Slow Slip, Tremor, and the Patchwork Mechanics of Megathrust Faults (Geology)
===========================================================================================
(Word count: 623)

Along Earth’s active continental margins, one tectonic plate can dive beneath another,
producing a subduction zone that stores strain for centuries and then releases it abruptly.
The largest earthquakes on the planet—megathrust events—occur on these gently sloping
interfaces, where friction can lock two plates together even as the plates continue to
converge. To a coastal community, the relevant question is not merely whether an earthquake
will happen, but how the interface fails: does it rupture quickly and send a tsunami, or
does it slip in ways that release strain quietly?

For much of the twentieth century, the popular image was binary. Either a fault was locked,
accumulating stress, or it slipped during a quake. That picture began to change when
geodesists installed dense networks of GPS receivers, capable of measuring ground motion to
within millimeters. In some regions, the GPS time series showed a puzzling pattern: the land
would creep backward for weeks and then recover, as if the overriding plate were briefly
“unbending” and then returning. These transient signals did not resemble a large earthquake,
yet they were too coherent to be noise. [A] The inference was that the plate interface had
slipped, but in a slow, smooth way that radiated little high‑frequency seismic energy.

Slow slip events are now recognized as a distinct mode of fault behavior. They often occur
at depths below the portion of the interface that ruptures catastrophically, and they can
repeat with a rough periodicity, such as every year or two in some subduction systems. Their
existence implies that friction is not uniform. Temperature, fluid pressure, and mineral
composition can all alter how rocks resist motion. Where fluids are trapped, elevated pore
pressure can reduce effective normal stress, making sliding easier. Conversely, where the
interface is cooler and drier, asperities can weld, promoting locking and sudden rupture.

A striking companion signal is tectonic tremor: a low‑amplitude, rumbling seismic vibration
that can persist for hours or days, lacking the sharp onset of ordinary quakes. In some
regions, tremor and slow slip occur together, suggesting that the interface is not sliding
as a single smooth patch but as a mosaic of tiny failures embedded in a broader creep. [B]
One way to imagine it is as a carpet being pulled: most of it moves continuously, yet little
snags release in brief jerks.

The relationship between slow slip and hazard is complicated. On one hand, slow slip
releases some of the strain that would otherwise load the locked zone. On the other hand, by
changing stress on adjacent locked patches, a slow slip event can, in principle, bring a
fault closer to the conditions required for a large rupture. Whether it relieves or promotes
hazard depends on geometry and timing. A slow slip episode that migrates up‑dip toward the
shallow locked zone may increase stress where a tsunami‑generating rupture would begin; a
deep slow slip that stays far away may have negligible effect.

Researchers therefore combine multiple measurements. GPS reveals the silent surface
deformation, while ocean-bottom pressure sensors can detect subtle sea-level changes that
accompany seafloor motion. Seismometers capture tremor, and laboratory experiments on rock
friction explore how temperature and fluids alter sliding stability. The emerging view is
not that faults choose between “quiet” and “violent” once and for all, but that a single
interface can host multiple modes of motion, each favored by local conditions. [C]

If the interface is a patchwork, then forecasting becomes a matter of mapping that
patchwork: identifying where locking is persistent, where slow slip recurs, and how stress
transfers between them. [D] In that sense, slow slip is valuable not because it guarantees
safety, but because it reveals, in real time, how a megathrust breathes between
catastrophes.

   B. Seismometers detected sharp, high-frequency shaking every few hours
   C. Tsunamis occurred without any ground movement
   D. Subducting plates stopped converging for decades

3. [Inference] What can be inferred about why fluids on a fault interface can promote sliding?
   A. High pore pressure reduces effective normal stress, making frictional resistance lower
   B. Fluids increase welding by cooling the interface
   C. Fluids eliminate the need for plate convergence

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author compare tremor and slow slip to “a carpet being pulled”?
   A. To illustrate how mostly continuous motion can include small, intermittent jerks at localized snags
   B. To argue that carpets cause earthquakes
   C. To show that tremor always precedes tsunamis

   B. It presents a biography of a geodesist
   C. It lists earthquakes by date without mechanisms
   D. It focuses solely on tsunami evacuation plans

8. [Reference] In the passage, “these transient signals” refers to:

   C. daily tides measured by pressure sensors
   D. volcanic eruptions near trenches

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that the interface “hosts multiple modes of motion”?
   A. Different parts of the same fault can alternate between locked rupture, slow creep, and tremor-like microfailures depending on local conditions

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Megathrust earthquakes occur only because plates stop converging at subduction zones.
   B. The passage explains how GPS and seismic observations revealed slow slip and tremor as additional fault behaviors, describes how fluids and temperature influence whether sliding is stable or abrupt, and argues that understanding the patchwork of fault modes is crucial for assessing megathrust hazard.
   C. Tectonic tremor is identical to ordinary earthquakes but simply quieter.
   D. Slow slip guarantees that tsunami risk is eliminated along subduction margins.
