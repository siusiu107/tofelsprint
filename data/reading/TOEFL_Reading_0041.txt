Passage 0041: Slow Slip, Tremor, and the Patchwork Mechanics of Megathrust Faults (Geology)
===========================================================================================
(Word count: 623)

Along Earth’s active continental margins, one tectonic plate can dive beneath another,
producing a subduction zone that stores strain for centuries and then releases it abruptly.
The largest earthquakes on the planet—megathrust events—occur on these gently sloping
interfaces, where friction can lock two plates together even as the plates continue to
converge. To a coastal community, the relevant question is not merely whether an earthquake
will happen, but how the interface fails: does it rupture quickly and send a tsunami, or
does it slip in ways that release strain quietly?

For much of the twentieth century, the popular image was binary. Either a fault was locked,
accumulating stress, or it slipped during a quake. That picture began to change when
geodesists installed dense networks of GPS receivers, capable of measuring ground motion to
within millimeters. In some regions, the GPS time series showed a puzzling pattern: the land
would creep backward for weeks and then recover, as if the overriding plate were briefly
“unbending” and then returning. These transient signals did not resemble a large earthquake,
yet they were too coherent to be noise. [A] The inference was that the plate interface had
slipped, but in a slow, smooth way that radiated little high‑frequency seismic energy.

Slow slip events are now recognized as a distinct mode of fault behavior. They often occur
at depths below the portion of the interface that ruptures catastrophically, and they can
repeat with a rough periodicity, such as every year or two in some subduction systems. Their
existence implies that friction is not uniform. Temperature, fluid pressure, and mineral
composition can all alter how rocks resist motion. Where fluids are trapped, elevated pore
pressure can reduce effective normal stress, making sliding easier. Conversely, where the
interface is cooler and drier, asperities can weld, promoting locking and sudden rupture.

A striking companion signal is tectonic tremor: a low‑amplitude, rumbling seismic vibration
that can persist for hours or days, lacking the sharp onset of ordinary quakes. In some
regions, tremor and slow slip occur together, suggesting that the interface is not sliding
as a single smooth patch but as a mosaic of tiny failures embedded in a broader creep. [B]
One way to imagine it is as a carpet being pulled: most of it moves continuously, yet little
snags release in brief jerks.

The relationship between slow slip and hazard is complicated. On one hand, slow slip
releases some of the strain that would otherwise load the locked zone. On the other hand, by
changing stress on adjacent locked patches, a slow slip event can, in principle, bring a
fault closer to the conditions required for a large rupture. Whether it relieves or promotes
hazard depends on geometry and timing. A slow slip episode that migrates up‑dip toward the
shallow locked zone may increase stress where a tsunami‑generating rupture would begin; a
deep slow slip that stays far away may have negligible effect.

Researchers therefore combine multiple measurements. GPS reveals the silent surface
deformation, while ocean-bottom pressure sensors can detect subtle sea-level changes that
accompany seafloor motion. Seismometers capture tremor, and laboratory experiments on rock
friction explore how temperature and fluids alter sliding stability. The emerging view is
not that faults choose between “quiet” and “violent” once and for all, but that a single
interface can host multiple modes of motion, each favored by local conditions. [C]

If the interface is a patchwork, then forecasting becomes a matter of mapping that
patchwork: identifying where locking is persistent, where slow slip recurs, and how stress
transfers between them. [D] In that sense, slow slip is valuable not because it guarantees
safety, but because it reveals, in real time, how a megathrust breathes between
catastrophes.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: To a coastal community, the relevant question is not merely whether an earthquake will happen, but how the interface fails: does it rupture quickly and send a tsunami, or does it slip in ways that release strain quietly?
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to stress and rupture
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across locked
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of locked
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains interface by linking stress to rupture, and it shows why locked changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents rupture as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once stress is observed, competing explanations for interface collapse. It treats locked as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage concedes that stress is often incomplete and concludes that interface cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since locked overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of rupture with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, especially regarding rupture.
   D. The passage surveys interface but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed rupture first, with stress serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats locked as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that locked mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes stress effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of rupture no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain interface, especially regarding locked, for the main claim of the text.
   B. A persuasive account would predict how interface should change if locked is altered, instead of assuming that stress has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to rupture must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   C. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in locked, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of stress is enough to validate rupture for interface.
   D. The passage treats stress primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over rupture are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about interface are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of rupture as a factor influencing stress
   B. discussion of locked as a factor influencing stress, especially regarding motion.
   C. discussion of interface as a factor influencing stress
   D. discussion of epigenetic imprinting as a factor influencing stress

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: To a coastal community, the relevant question is not merely whether an earthquake will happen, but how the interface fails: does it rupture quickly and send a tsunami, or does it slip in ways that release strain quietly?
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. To a coastal community. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. To a coastal community. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once stress fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and locked can be ignored without changing conclusions about interface.
   B. Because stress directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding interface.
   C. Because the presence of rupture guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in locked are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because comparability prevents rupture from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold locked constant while examining stress.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | stress | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | locked | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves rupture is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that interface should be read alongside locked, because stress alone does not settle what rupture means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: These transient signals did not resemble a large earthquake, yet they were too coherent to be noise.
   A. the preceding claim that interface functions as a direct measurement of rupture
   B. the preceding claim that locked alone explains the outcome of interface
   C. the preceding claim about how stress is interpreted in relation to rupture
   D. the preceding claim that stress is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of stress lead to different conclusions about interface.
   B. to show that the term interface belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses rupture, so debate over stress is unnecessary noise, especially regarding interface, especially regarding rupture.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of stress and rupture should be abandoned altogether.
