Passage 0491: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 730)

Despite seemingly clear effect sizes, the passage argues that researchers have treated
increased liking for chosen options as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization. Although meta-analytic synthesis can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on self-concept threat, the author treats
the complication as diagnostic, so many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized
increased liking for chosen options as a signature, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ. this shift mattered for how evidence
from cross-national survey samples was generalized because local conditions can change which
processes generate increased liking for chosen options, which is why replication matters. In
this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat occurred
when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] At first
glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. by comparing
cases in which meta-analytic synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. [B] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions
are tested. To be sure, a single case can be dramatic, yet the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] That
point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows. [D] The discussion treats
exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded.

Even if the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how self-concept
threat can shift baselines, altering whether increased liking for chosen options is even
comparable across cases, an outcome that means that a good fit is not the same as a good
explanation. Were self-concept threat is changed while the nominal driver remains constant
to fail, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In this sense,
dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation is granted, then the same observation—increased liking for chosen options—must
be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat increased liking for chosen options as an endpoint, the passage treats it as
a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

Not until analysts began combining meta-analytic synthesis with cross-site comparisons was
it clear that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which increased liking for chosen options could be explained in more
than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like self-concept threat often co-
vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without
implying that any story is arbitrary. Despite the fact that the temptation to treat a tidy
plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which increased liking
for chosen options is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through
habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that increased liking for chosen options is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away cultural norms about consistency, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using implicit association tests.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when cultural norms about consistency can mimic increased liking for chosen options.

2. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested.
   A. longitudinal attitude surveys as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. measurement reactivity alone, treated as the sole cause

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on longitudinal attitude surveys simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in workplace decision settings and everywhere else.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **plausible** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Not until analysts began combining meta-analytic synthesis with cross-site comparisons was it clear that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
   A. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   B. reasonable
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because cultural norms about consistency dominates all evidence
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like longitudinal attitude surveys are needed

5. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In short, the passage treats methodological humility as a strength, not as an admission of ignorance.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using meta-analytic synthesis are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting meta-analytic synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats meta-analytic synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining meta-analytic synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.

   C. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   D. Can vary across epochs

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The discussion suggests that measurement reactivity is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains measurement reactivity
   C. The author argues that implicit association tests should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The passage implies that workplace decision settings is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

10. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if longitudinal attitude surveys produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once increased liking for chosen options is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. it prevents increased liking for chosen options from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control self-concept threat
   D. Because self-concept threat co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
