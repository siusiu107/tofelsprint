Passage 0803: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 721)

When memory is tested repeatedly, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated selective memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization. Despite the fact that meta-analytic
synthesis can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence
is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less
about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike consumer choice studies. The passage
argues that the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms
differed because measurement reactivity shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating
selective memory for supporting evidence as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the
assumptions differ. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity,
does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which meta-analytic synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could
ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Only through analysts began combining meta-analytic synthesis with cross-site comparisons
could one reasonably claim that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which selective memory for supporting
evidence could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like
measurement reactivity often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, dissonance reduction
after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation is granted, then the same observation—selective memory for supporting
evidence—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an endpoint in
one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts in another.

Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] The passage frames
uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment. by comparing
cases in which meta-analytic synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as
a decisive test. Even if a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value
of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] The author
notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. [D] The passage
highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. In this sense, self-
justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. While
it is true that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the
result is a framework in which selective memory for supporting evidence is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting choice-induced preference paradigms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats choice-induced preference paradigms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using choice-induced preference paradigms are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining choice-induced preference paradigms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.

2. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats workplace decision settings as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   B. The passage suggests that selective memory for supporting evidence is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when measurement reactivity can mimic selective memory for supporting evidence.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using behavioral priming designs.

3. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | meta-analytic synthesis | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | devaluation of rejected alternatives | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | measurement reactivity | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It proves increased liking for chosen options is unique.
   B. Shifts the baseline
   C. It makes public versus private commitment irrelevant.
   D. Can be degenerate with another effect

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In other words, the disagreement is not about whether the data exist, but about what the data are evidence for.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on choice-induced preference paradigms simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if implicit association tests produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. The passage implies that implicit association tests directly measures causes, meaning confounding from public versus private commitment is impossible.
   D. Because public versus private commitment co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **coherent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence
   C. well organized
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like meta-analytic synthesis are needed

8. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. a list of Olympic medal counts
   B. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   C. increased liking for chosen options
   D. choice-induced preference paradigms

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:

   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The author argues that longitudinal attitude surveys should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal attitude surveys constrains cultural norms about consistency
   C. The passage treats increased liking for chosen options as a confounder and cultural norms about consistency as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The discussion suggests that cultural norms about consistency is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
