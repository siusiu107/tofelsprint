Passage 0079: Scripts, Sound, and the Politics of Standard Spelling
===================================================================
(Word count: 615)

Writing systems are often taught as if they were designed: an inventor chooses symbols,
assigns sounds, and a script appears fully formed. In reality, scripts evolve through
compromises among speech, memory, technology, and social authority. A writing system must be
learnable, yet it must also serve administrative and cultural needs. Because spoken language
changes and because communities borrow from one another, scripts rarely remain stable
without institutional reinforcement.

One major contrast is between logographic systems, in which symbols represent words or
morphemes, and alphabetic systems, in which symbols represent sounds. Logographic writing
can encode meaning across dialects: readers who pronounce words differently may still
recognize the same character. This feature can be useful in large polities with linguistic
diversity, but it carries a learning cost, because many symbols must be mastered. Alphabetic
systems reduce symbol inventory by mapping to sounds, which can lower initial learning
barriers, but they become sensitive to pronunciation change. When sounds shift over
centuries, spelling can fossilize older pronunciations, producing mismatches between letters
and speech. [A] Thus, a script that appears “efficient” in one era can accumulate complexity
in another.

Historical transitions show how scripts respond to practical pressures. The Phoenician
consonantal alphabet, suited to Semitic languages, was adapted by Greeks, who repurposed
some consonant symbols to represent vowels. That modification made the script more flexible
for languages in which vowel contrasts carry heavy grammatical load. Later, the Latin
alphabet spread with Roman administration and, centuries afterward, with Christian
manuscript culture and printing. Each stage involved both adoption and adaptation. Local
scribes adjusted letter forms, and local phonologies pushed spelling in different
directions.

Technology can accelerate standardization. In manuscript cultures, variation flourishes
because copying is local and errors or preferences propagate within small networks.
Printing, by contrast, favors uniform typefaces and encourages consistent spellings because
editions reach large audiences. State schooling intensifies the effect by teaching “correct”
forms, and dictionaries and grammar books codify them. Yet standardization is never
complete. Dialects persist, and writers sometimes use nonstandard forms to signal identity
or intimacy. [B] The result is a tension: the script is both a tool of coordination and a
medium of social difference.

Scripts can also reshape language. When a community adopts a new writing system, certain
distinctions become easier to mark and others become harder. A script that marks vowels
explicitly can encourage attention to vowel contrasts; a script that does not may lead
readers to infer them from context. Orthographic reforms, such as those proposed to simplify
spelling, are therefore not purely technical; they alter what a language visibly emphasizes.
Reforms can succeed when institutions enforce them, but they can also fail when older
spellings carry prestige or when competing standards exist.

Writing systems, then, are neither transparent mirrors of speech nor arbitrary codes. [C]
They are evolving infrastructures that mediate between what people say, how they learn, and
how institutions coordinate meaning over time. [D]

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: A script that marks vowels explicitly can encourage attention to vowel contrasts; a script that does not may lead readers to infer them from context.
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to taught and small
   C. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across books
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of books

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains script by linking taught to small, and it shows why books changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents small as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once taught is observed, competing explanations for script collapse. It treats books as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage concedes that taught is often incomplete and concludes that script cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since books overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of small with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, especially regarding schools.
   D. The passage surveys script but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed small first, with taught serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats books as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that books mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes taught effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of small no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain script, as the discussion implies.
   B. A persuasive account would predict how script should change if books is altered, instead of assuming that taught has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to small must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   C. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in books, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of taught is enough to validate small for script, in the context of the passage.
   D. The passage treats taught primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over small are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about script are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of script as a factor influencing taught, especially regarding script.
   B. discussion of books as a factor influencing taught
   C. discussion of stress corrosion cracking as a factor influencing taught
   D. discussion of small as a factor influencing taught

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: A script that marks vowels explicitly can encourage attention to vowel contrasts; a script that does not may lead readers to infer them from context.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding taught.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. A script that marks vowels explicitly can encourage attention to vowel contrasts. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   D. A script that marks vowels explicitly can encourage attention to vowel contrasts. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents small from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold books constant while examining taught.
   B. Because taught directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding script.
   C. Because once taught fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and books can be ignored without changing conclusions about script.
   D. Because the presence of small guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in books are merely stylistic noise.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | taught | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | books | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves small is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that script should be read alongside books, because taught alone does not settle what small means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This feature can be useful in large polities with linguistic diversity, but it carries a learning cost, because many symbols must be mastered.
   A. the idea that Writing systems, then, are neither transparent mirrors of speech nor arbitrary codes, in the context of the passage.
   B. the idea that Logographic writing can encode meaning across dialects: readers who pronounce words differently may still recognize the same character
   C. the idea that One major contrast is between logographic systems, in which symbols represent words or morphemes, and alphabetic systems, in which symbols represent sounds
   D. the idea that Alphabetic systems reduce symbol inventory by mapping to sounds, which can lower initial learning barriers, but they become sensitive to pronunciation change
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term script belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses small, so debate over taught is unnecessary noise, especially regarding books, within the passage’s scope.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of taught and small should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of taught lead to different conclusions about script.
