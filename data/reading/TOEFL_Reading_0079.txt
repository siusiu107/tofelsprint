Passage 0079: Scripts, Sound, and the Politics of Standard Spelling
===================================================================
(Word count: 615)

Writing systems are often taught as if they were designed: an inventor chooses symbols,
assigns sounds, and a script appears fully formed. In reality, scripts evolve through
compromises among speech, memory, technology, and social authority. A writing system must be
learnable, yet it must also serve administrative and cultural needs. Because spoken language
changes and because communities borrow from one another, scripts rarely remain stable
without institutional reinforcement.

One major contrast is between logographic systems, in which symbols represent words or
morphemes, and alphabetic systems, in which symbols represent sounds. Logographic writing
can encode meaning across dialects: readers who pronounce words differently may still
recognize the same character. This feature can be useful in large polities with linguistic
diversity, but it carries a learning cost, because many symbols must be mastered. Alphabetic
systems reduce symbol inventory by mapping to sounds, which can lower initial learning
barriers, but they become sensitive to pronunciation change. When sounds shift over
centuries, spelling can fossilize older pronunciations, producing mismatches between letters
and speech. [A] Thus, a script that appears “efficient” in one era can accumulate complexity
in another.

Historical transitions show how scripts respond to practical pressures. The Phoenician
consonantal alphabet, suited to Semitic languages, was adapted by Greeks, who repurposed
some consonant symbols to represent vowels. That modification made the script more flexible
for languages in which vowel contrasts carry heavy grammatical load. Later, the Latin
alphabet spread with Roman administration and, centuries afterward, with Christian
manuscript culture and printing. Each stage involved both adoption and adaptation. Local
scribes adjusted letter forms, and local phonologies pushed spelling in different
directions.

Technology can accelerate standardization. In manuscript cultures, variation flourishes
because copying is local and errors or preferences propagate within small networks.
Printing, by contrast, favors uniform typefaces and encourages consistent spellings because
editions reach large audiences. State schooling intensifies the effect by teaching “correct”
forms, and dictionaries and grammar books codify them. Yet standardization is never
complete. Dialects persist, and writers sometimes use nonstandard forms to signal identity
or intimacy. [B] The result is a tension: the script is both a tool of coordination and a
medium of social difference.

Scripts can also reshape language. When a community adopts a new writing system, certain
distinctions become easier to mark and others become harder. A script that marks vowels
explicitly can encourage attention to vowel contrasts; a script that does not may lead
readers to infer them from context. Orthographic reforms, such as those proposed to simplify
spelling, are therefore not purely technical; they alter what a language visibly emphasizes.
Reforms can succeed when institutions enforce them, but they can also fail when older
spellings carry prestige or when competing standards exist.

Writing systems, then, are neither transparent mirrors of speech nor arbitrary codes. [C]
They are evolving infrastructures that mediate between what people say, how they learn, and
how institutions coordinate meaning over time. [D]

Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, why can logographic writing be useful in polities with dialect diversity?
   A. Readers who pronounce words differently may still recognize the same character representing meaning
   B. Logographic systems require fewer symbols than alphabets
   C. Logographic writing automatically updates when pronunciation changes
   D. It prevents any social signaling through spelling

2. [Vocabulary] The word “fossilize” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. preserve in an older form
   B. erase completely
   C. accelerate rapidly
   D. translate into another language

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Spelling, once printed and taught, can become a record of earlier speech rather than a guide to current pronunciation.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why printing tends to reduce orthographic variation?
   A. Because widely distributed editions and uniform typefaces promote consistent forms across many readers
   B. Because printing makes people speak more slowly
   C. Because printers intentionally change pronunciation
   D. Because variation is impossible in any manuscript culture

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as forces that promote standardization EXCEPT:
   A. printing
   B. state schooling
   C. dictionaries and grammar books
   D. subduction-zone fluids raising pore pressure

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss the Greek adaptation of Phoenician symbols into vowels?
   A. To illustrate how scripts are modified to suit linguistic needs rather than adopted unchanged
   B. To argue that Greek had no consonants
   C. To claim that alphabets always originate in Rome
   D. To show that logographic systems are impossible to learn

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the result” refers to:
   A. the continuing tension between coordination through standard forms and social difference expressed through variation
   B. the immediate disappearance of dialects after printing
   C. the conversion of sunlight into electricity
   D. the migration of ions in crystal lattices

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It contrasts logographic and alphabetic scripts, traces historical adaptations and technological influences on standardization, then discusses how scripts interact with language change and reform
   B. It lists alphabets by the number of letters only
   C. It argues that writing has no relationship to institutions
   D. It focuses on one reform and ignores history

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that scripts are “evolving infrastructures”?
   A. They develop over time through interactions among speech, learning, technology, and authority, shaping and shaped by social use
   B. They are fixed inventions that never change after creation
   C. They function only as artistic decoration with no coordination role
   D. They replace spoken language entirely

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Writing systems are designed once by inventors and then remain unchanged regardless of society.
   B. The passage explains that scripts evolve through compromises among language, learning, technology, and institutions, contrasts logographic and alphabetic systems and their tradeoffs, shows how historical borrowing and printing and schooling promote standardization without eliminating variation, and argues that scripts can both reflect and reshape language through orthography and reform.
   C. Printing destroyed all dialects and produced a single global language.
   D. Alphabetic systems always encode meaning better than logographic systems across dialects.
