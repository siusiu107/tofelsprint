Passage 0761: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 643)

Despite seemingly clear effect sizes, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated
devaluation of rejected alternatives as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization. While it is true that choice-induced preference paradigms can make
the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using choice-induced preference paradigms under stable conditions, the interpretation
shifts, and one frequently cited case from political opinion panels appeared to support the
direct-readout view. Though the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in cultural norms about consistency altered the baseline
enough to mute or mimic devaluation of rejected alternatives. the passage treats this
episode as diagnostic, which illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency, does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which choice-induced preference paradigms constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is
precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. [A] This becomes a pivot point where the
earlier interpretation is narrowed. If one wishes to move from description to explanation, a
different prediction follows: then the same observation—devaluation of rejected
alternatives—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
[B] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.
Whereas popular summaries treat devaluation of rejected alternatives as an endpoint looks
decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. [C] This is presented not
as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. [D] The author implies that
replication is informative only when protocols are comparable. In this sense, dissonance
reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on cultural norms about consistency, the
passage suggests many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized
devaluation of rejected alternatives as a signature may be convenient, later work asked
whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ is scientifically
revealing. this shift mattered for how evidence from political opinion panels was
generalized because local conditions can change which processes generate devaluation of
rejected alternatives. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Admittedly,
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; nevertheless, the
result is a framework in which devaluation of rejected alternatives is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **sparse** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Working with sparse records and limited controls on cultural norms about consistency, the passage suggests many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon.
   A. thinly spread
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like longitudinal attitude surveys are needed
   C. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because cultural norms about consistency dominates all evidence

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on implicit association tests simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates cultural norms about consistency.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-national survey samples and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies one mechanism.

3. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | implicit association tests | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | increased liking for chosen options | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | public versus private commitment | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   B. It replaces longitudinal attitude surveys with intuition.
   C. Samples only part of the system
   D. It makes cultural norms about consistency irrelevant.

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The passage implies that political opinion panels is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'self-justification mechanisms' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains measurement reactivity
   D. The discussion suggests that measurement reactivity is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

5. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. choice-induced preference paradigms
   B. a recipe for bread fermentation
   C. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   D. devaluation of rejected alternatives

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. public versus private commitment alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. implicit association tests as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. devaluation of rejected alternatives specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal attitude surveys with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   B. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal attitude surveys are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal attitude surveys as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal attitude surveys as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if implicit association tests produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. The passage implies that implicit association tests directly measures causes, meaning confounding from measurement reactivity is impossible.
   C. it prevents devaluation of rejected alternatives from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity
   D. Since devaluation of rejected alternatives is observed in workplace decision settings, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

9. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats consumer choice studies as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away cultural norms about consistency, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when cultural norms about consistency can mimic shifted confidence judgments.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using behavioral priming designs.

10. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: As a result, the most valuable observations are often taken during transitions, when competing mechanisms diverge most clearly.

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]
