Passage 0900: Agricultural Revolutions and the Reorganization of Rural Labor (History)
======================================================================================
(Word count: 755)

Across multiple northern cities, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated changes
in tenancy patterns as the decisive sign of agricultural revolutions and the reorganization
of rural labor. Granted that estate account analysis can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Rarely has it been the case
that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical, at least before
the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify market integration. by comparing cases
in which estate account analysis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, a move that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In
this sense, technological change in agriculture is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label. In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike postwar East
Asian countryside. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying
mechanisms differed because, as the author notes, market integration shifted the baseline in
different directions across sites. The issue is not treating changes in tenancy patterns as
a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation. Only after analysts began combining estate account analysis with cross-site
comparisons did claims about agricultural revolutions and the reorganization of rural labor
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which changes in tenancy patterns could be explained in more
than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like market integration often co-vary
with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. Not until analysts began combining estate account analysis with cross-site
comparisons did claims about agricultural revolutions and the reorganization of rural labor
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. The
passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which changes in tenancy patterns
could be explained in more than one way because confounders like market integration often
co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable. In this sense, restructuring of rural work under mechanization is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. It is methodological
humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage presents as the lesson of
agricultural revolutions and the reorganization of rural labor: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. [A] The author uses the example to separate
detection from interpretation. Provided that one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—changes in tenancy patterns—must be paired with tests
that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] This becomes a pivot point where the
earlier interpretation is narrowed. Whereas popular summaries treat changes in tenancy
patterns as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions.
[C] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. [D] The
passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence. Hardly had the field
adopted tests that manipulate or stratify market integration occurred when the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which estate
account analysis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive
out of sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this
sense, shifts from subsistence to market farming is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label. In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when market integration can mimic changes in tenancy patterns.
   B. The passage suggests that changes in tenancy patterns is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away market integration, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The author treats Mediterranean rural regions as a special case and argues that no broader inference about agricultural revolutions and the reorganization of rural labor is possible.

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'restructuring of rural work under mechanization' refers to a different field altogether, not to agricultural revolutions and the reorganization of rural labor.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where demographic inference from parish registers constrains climatic shocks
   C. The author argues that demographic inference from parish registers should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The discussion suggests that climatic shocks is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines agricultural revolutions and the reorganization of rural labor and argues that changes in tenancy patterns is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how market integration can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Mediterranean rural regions. Finally, it maintains that tests combining price series reconstruction with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about technological change in agriculture robust.
   B. The passage argues that shifts from subsistence to market farming cannot be studied empirically because confounders like market integration make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting price series reconstruction as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats price series reconstruction as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in tenancy patterns or market integration. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that restructuring of rural work under mechanization is settled because changes in tenancy patterns uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that market integration is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using price series reconstruction are unnecessary.

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage presents as the lesson of agricultural revolutions and the reorganization of rural labor: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on price series reconstruction simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in nineteenth-century Midwestern farms and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because wage compression or expansion uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates climatic shocks.

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | demographic inference from parish registers | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | changes in tenancy patterns | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | climatic shocks | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Depends on modeling priors
   B. Adds correlated noise
   C. It makes climatic shocks irrelevant.
   D. It replaces demographic inference from parish registers with intuition.

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. Because climatic shocks co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if price series reconstruction produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. Since land-use intensification is observed in Mediterranean rural regions, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. it prevents land-use intensification from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control climatic shocks

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. land-use intensification
   B. demographic inference from parish registers
   C. a list of Olympic medal counts
   D. Agricultural Revolutions and the Reorganization of Rural Labor

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. estate account analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. land-use intensification specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. market integration alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **idiosyncratic** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because climatic shocks dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to agricultural revolutions and the reorganization of rural labor, serving only as background detail
   C. peculiar to one case
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like price series reconstruction are needed
