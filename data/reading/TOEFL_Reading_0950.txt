Passage 0950: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 790)

In large-scale platform studies, researchers found that researchers have treated disparate
exposure to pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. While it is true that audit studies in housing markets can make the
pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Not until analysts began combining audit studies in housing markets with cross-site
comparisons did claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate exposure to pollution
could be explained in more than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like
zoning rules and land-use regulation often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is
precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, spatial
stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one
wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the same observation—disparate
exposure to pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint
looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication.

What matters most is the apparent regularity of disparate exposure to pollution, which is
why drives the first interpretation: disparate exposure to pollution is treated as a direct
readout of mechanism. If disparate exposure to pollution is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway, then observations from European migrant neighborhoods would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. The issue is not the caveat that zoning rules and
land-use regulation might reproduce the same pattern; it is that the literature is full of
such claims. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Admittedly, the first model can fit one dataset extremely well; nevertheless, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. [A] The author uses
the detour to show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. it
highlights how zoning rules and land-use regulation can shift baselines, altering whether
disparate exposure to pollution is even comparable across cases, an outcome that means that
a good fit is not the same as a good explanation. [B] The author treats this as a clue
rather than as a nuisance. Should zoning rules and land-use regulation is changed while the
nominal driver remains constant be true, one should expect different outcomes when
conditions are perturbed. [C] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on
what the data cannot rule out. [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier
interpretation is narrowed.

Seldom, prior to analysts began combining audit studies in housing markets with cross-site
comparisons, did investigators concede that claims about residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate
exposure to pollution could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
zoning rules and land-use regulation often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication
matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why
the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. To
be sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, yet the
result is a framework in which disparate exposure to pollution is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that school-quality gradients is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how zoning rules and land-use regulation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from European migrant neighborhoods. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal panel data with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal panel data as a historical curiosity and does not discuss school-quality gradients or zoning rules and land-use regulation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like zoning rules and land-use regulation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal panel data as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that zoning rules and land-use regulation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal panel data are unnecessary.

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.

   D. school-quality gradients

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing theories?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where audit studies in housing markets constrains path dependence from historical redlining
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   C. The passage treats school-quality gradients as a confounder and path dependence from historical redlining as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The passage implies that rapidly growing Sun Belt regions is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

5. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when path dependence from historical redlining can mimic wealth accumulation gaps.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away path dependence from historical redlining, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The author treats rapidly growing Sun Belt regions as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   D. The passage suggests that wealth accumulation gaps is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates zoning rules and land-use regulation.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in European migrant neighborhoods and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because wealth accumulation gaps uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on longitudinal panel data simple.

10. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that quasi-experimental policy evaluation directly measures causes, meaning confounding from path dependence from historical redlining is impossible.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once school-quality gradients is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. it prevents school-quality gradients from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control path dependence from historical redlining
   D. Because school-quality gradients appears, the mechanism must be unique, so path dependence from historical redlining can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
