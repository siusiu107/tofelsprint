Passage 0816: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 751)

In classic laboratory tasks, researchers found that researchers have treated increased
liking for chosen options as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. Although implicit association tests can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather
than rely on familiar narratives.

Using implicit association tests under stable conditions, the key question becomes whether
one frequently cited case from political opinion panels appeared to support the direct-
readout view. [A] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as
conditional. Even though the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in self-concept threat altered the baseline enough to
mute or mimic increased liking for chosen options. [B] The author notes that generalization
requires more than a single well-chosen case. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic,
which forces analysts to admit that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted. [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier
interpretation is narrowed. [D] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric
would lead to a different conclusion. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which implicit association tests constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can be dramatic, the author does
not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on self-concept threat, it is difficult to
deny that many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization
as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized increased liking for
chosen options as a signature may be convenient, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ is scientifically revealing. this shift
mattered for how evidence from political opinion panels was generalized in part because
local conditions can change which processes generate increased liking for chosen options. In
this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Rarely has it been the case that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions, at least before analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-
site comparisons. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which
increased liking for chosen options could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like self-concept threat often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in
turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—increased liking for chosen
options—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot
be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat increased liking for chosen
options as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. In
this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even
though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which increased liking for chosen options is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. public versus private commitment alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. shifted confidence judgments specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. longitudinal attitude surveys as a device rather than as an analytic approach

2. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
   B. Since selective memory for supporting evidence is observed in consumer choice studies, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if behavioral priming designs produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once selective memory for supporting evidence is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that self-concept threat is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using implicit association tests are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats implicit association tests as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or self-concept threat. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how self-concept threat can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining implicit association tests with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like self-concept threat make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting implicit association tests as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The passage implies that 'noise' is sometimes a label for unmodeled structure rather than a property of the world itself.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | choice-induced preference paradigms | Samples only part of the system |

   D. Changes the apparent slope

6. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **robust** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [A] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence
   B. strong and reliable
   C. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like meta-analytic synthesis are needed

7. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the passage juxtapose two accounts of the phenomenon?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains public versus private commitment
   B. The passage implies that consumer choice studies is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The discussion suggests that public versus private commitment is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'post-choice attitude change' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.

8. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using meta-analytic synthesis.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving meta-analytic synthesis.
   C. The author treats consumer choice studies as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when self-concept threat can mimic shifted confidence judgments.

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. behavioral priming designs

10. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on choice-induced preference paradigms simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in workplace decision settings and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.
