Passage 0940: Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments (Psychology)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 783)

In replication efforts, researchers have treated strategy shifts over trials as the decisive
sign of retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments. Despite the fact that paired-
associate tasks can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, something that
forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.
In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike classroom study settings. The passage
argues that the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms
differed because encoding strength heterogeneity shifted the baseline in different
directions across sites. The issue is not treating strategy shifts over trials as a self-
sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation. In this sense, practice-driven suppression of competing memories is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. The decisive factor is
methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as the lesson of
retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation
holds, then the same observation—strategy shifts over trials—must be paired with tests that
change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat strategy
shifts over trials as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point
for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under
replication. Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify encoding
strength heterogeneity did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate
became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which
paired-associate tasks constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. Seldom, prior to analysts began combining paired-associate tasks with cross-
site comparisons, did investigators concede that claims about retrieval-induced forgetting
in memory experiments stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which strategy shifts over trials could
be explained in more than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like encoding
strength heterogeneity often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, retrieval-based
inhibition is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Only when
the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify encoding strength heterogeneity did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] This detail becomes
important later, when assumptions are tested. by comparing cases in which paired-associate
tasks constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, an outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value
of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] The author
shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. [D] The
passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating them as afterthoughts. Rarely,
unless analysts began combining paired-associate tasks with cross-site comparisons, does one
see why claims about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which strategy shifts over trials could be explained in more than one way
because confounders like encoding strength heterogeneity often co-vary with the driver,
which is why replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an
empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, selective recall causing forgetting is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, researchers
found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about retrieval-
induced forgetting in memory experiments be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why
the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The discussion suggests that encoding strength heterogeneity is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The passage implies that classroom study settings is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'selective recall causing forgetting' refers to a different field altogether, not to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where fMRI pattern analysis constrains encoding strength heterogeneity

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats paired-associate tasks as a historical curiosity and does not discuss strategy shifts over trials or encoding strength heterogeneity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that retrieval-based inhibition is settled because strategy shifts over trials uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that encoding strength heterogeneity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using paired-associate tasks are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments and argues that strategy shifts over trials is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how encoding strength heterogeneity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-cultural replications. Finally, it maintains that tests combining paired-associate tasks with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about practice-driven suppression of competing memories robust.
   D. The passage argues that selective recall causing forgetting cannot be studied empirically because confounders like encoding strength heterogeneity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting paired-associate tasks as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This is why the author dwells on assumptions: without them, two teams can analyze the same record and still disagree honestly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **approximate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the goal was to break degeneracies in which strategy shifts over trials could be explained in more than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like encoding strength heterogeneity often co-vary with the driver.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like pre-registered replication are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because test expectancy effects dominates all evidence
   C. rough
   D. irrelevant to retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments, serving only as background detail

5. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents reduced recall of unpracticed items from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control stress modulation of recall
   B. Since reduced recall of unpracticed items is observed in clinical populations, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. The passage implies that paired-associate tasks directly measures causes, meaning confounding from stress modulation of recall is impossible.
   D. Because stress modulation of recall co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

6. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when test expectancy effects can mimic context-dependent effects.
   B. The author treats clinical populations as a special case and argues that no broader inference about retrieval-induced forgetting in memory experiments is possible.
   C. The passage suggests that context-dependent effects is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away test expectancy effects, since variability is merely a measurement error.

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Retrieval-Induced Forgetting in Memory Experiments
   B. the author’s favorite color
   C. metacognitive illusions
