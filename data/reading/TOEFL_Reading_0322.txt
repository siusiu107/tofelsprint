Passage 0322: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 741)

Under expanded parameter sweeps, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated poisoning by CO as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on
platinum surfaces. Even if DFT surface modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp,
the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than
rely on familiar narratives.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet dependence did the
earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became empirically productive
rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which DFT surface modeling constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, something that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even if a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only after analysts began combining DFT surface modeling with cross-site comparisons did the
earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about heterogeneous catalysis on
platinum surfaces stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which poisoning by CO could be explained
in more than one way in part because confounders like facet dependence often co-vary with
the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of heterogeneous
catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same
observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which
it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat poisoning by CO as an endpoint, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. In this
sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Only by analysts began combining DFT surface modeling with cross-site comparisons was the
field forced to accept that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which poisoning by CO could be explained in more than one way
because confounders like facet dependence often co-vary with the driver, which is why
replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable.

In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike automotive
catalytic converters. [A] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what
the data cannot rule out. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the
underlying mechanisms differed because, as the author notes, facet dependence shifted the
baseline in different directions across sites. [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but
as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. So the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation, and so, too, does the evidence undermine treating poisoning by CO as a self-
sufficient conclusion. [C] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating
them as afterthoughts. [D] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can
masquerade as mechanism. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; still, the
result is a framework in which poisoning by CO is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

   Sentence: [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like microkinetic modeling are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because catalyst deactivation dominates all evidence
   D. weakened

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. selectivity shifts
   B. in situ spectroscopy
   C. the author’s favorite color
   D. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the inference is underdetermined, the most informative tests are those that break degeneracies rather than those that merely sharpen one feature.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The author argues that surface microscopy should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where surface microscopy constrains catalyst deactivation
   C. The passage treats structure-sensitive activity as a confounder and catalyst deactivation as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'surface-mediated catalysis on Pt' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like adsorbate coverage effects make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting in situ spectroscopy as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats in situ spectroscopy as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rate enhancement or adsorbate coverage effects. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because rate enhancement uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that adsorbate coverage effects is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using in situ spectroscopy are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that rate enhancement is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how adsorbate coverage effects can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from laboratory single-crystal studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining in situ spectroscopy with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. it prevents selectivity shifts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control facet dependence
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once selectivity shifts is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. Because selectivity shifts appears, the mechanism must be unique, so facet dependence can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. The passage implies that microkinetic modeling directly measures causes, meaning confounding from facet dependence is impossible.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | surface microscopy | Samples only part of the system |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It makes catalyst deactivation irrelevant.
   B. Samples only part of the system
   C. Can be degenerate with another effect
   D. It replaces temperature-programmed desorption with intuition.

8. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats automotive catalytic converters as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away facet dependence, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facet dependence can mimic structure-sensitive activity.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using surface microscopy.

   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in laboratory single-crystal studies and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because structure-sensitive activity uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on microkinetic modeling simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates adsorbate coverage effects.
