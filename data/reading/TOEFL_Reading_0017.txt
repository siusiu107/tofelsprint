Passage 0017: Predators, Prey Behavior, and Context-Dependent Trophic Cascades (Ecology)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 643)

When large predators disappear, the change is not confined to the predator itself. It can
propagate through prey behavior, vegetation, and even riverbanks. This propagation is
sometimes called a trophic cascade, but the phrase can invite oversimplification, as if one
species toggles an ecosystem like a switch. In reality, cascades unfold through a series of
linked causes that depend on where animals move, what they eat, and how plants respond to
browsing pressure over time.

Consider a landscape in which wolves have been absent for decades. Ungulates such as elk can
become abundant, but abundance alone does not explain vegetation change. Predators also
shape prey behavior. Without wolves, elk may spend more time in open valley bottoms where
grasses and willows are accessible and where escape is easy. With wolves present, those same
open areas can become risky, and elk may shift toward steeper terrain or move more
frequently. The behavioral shift changes where browsing is concentrated even if the total
number of elk changes only modestly.

Such spatial redistribution matters for plants that grow slowly. Willows and aspens in
valley bottoms can be repeatedly browsed at the same height, preventing them from escaping
into tall stems. When browsing pressure drops—either because elk numbers decline, because
elk spend less time in vulnerable areas, or because harsh winters interact with predation—
young shoots can survive long enough to grow above the reach of constant browsing. [A] Once
stems reach that threshold, a small difference in browsing can produce a large difference in
plant structure, because the plant’s own growth then begins to outrun herbivory.

The plant changes can then influence other species. Beaver colonies, for example, rely on
willow as food and as building material. If willow stands recover, beavers can expand,
building dams that slow streams and create wetlands. Those wetlands can support amphibians
and alter sediment deposition. Meanwhile, denser riparian vegetation can stabilize
riverbanks, reducing erosion and changing channel shape. [B] In this way, the predator’s
influence can be expressed in places where the predator never spends much time, because the
pathway runs through prey and plants.

Yet cascades rarely proceed cleanly. In some regions, elk may switch to other browse
species, shifting pressure rather than removing it. In others, human hunting can reduce elk
numbers, complicating the attribution of change to wolves alone. Climate also matters. A
series of dry years can limit willow recovery even if browsing declines, while wetter years
can accelerate growth. The cascade, therefore, is conditional: predators can open a door,
but weather and habitat determine how far the system walks through it. [C]

This conditionality is precisely why trophic cascades are scientifically useful. They
encourage ecologists to ask mechanistic questions: Did prey numbers change, prey behavior
change, or both? Did plants cross a height threshold? Did riparian soils retain enough
moisture to support regrowth? Answering such questions can prevent the story from becoming a
fable and can reveal where management interventions are likely to work. If vegetation fails
to recover, perhaps the issue is not predator presence but lack of water or continued
browsing by another herbivore.

Seen as a chain rather than as a slogan, a cascade connects predators to landscapes through
ordinary processes: risk, movement, feeding, growth, and engineering by other species. [D]
The lesson is neither that wolves are magical nor that they are irrelevant. It is that
ecosystems are networks in which removing or restoring a strong interaction can redirect
many smaller interactions, sometimes visibly, sometimes subtly, and always in ways that
depend on context.

Time also creates surprises. Even if browsing pressure drops quickly, trees may take years
to seed and establish, and a single flood can uproot young stems before they mature.
Meanwhile, when ungulates concentrate in safer uplands, their grazing can alter grassland
composition there, meaning that a “recovered” valley can coincide with a changed hillside.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: When browsing pressure drops—either because elk numbers decline, because elk spend less time in vulnerable areas, or because harsh winters interact with predation— young shoots can survive long enough to grow above the reach of constant browsing.
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of predators
   C. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across predators
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to change and wolves

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains browsing by linking change to wolves, and it shows why predators changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents wolves as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once change is observed, competing explanations for browsing collapse. It treats predators as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage surveys browsing but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed wolves first, with change serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats predators as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, for the main claim of the text.
   D. The passage concedes that change is often incomplete and concludes that browsing cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since predators overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of wolves with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in predators, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of change is enough to validate wolves for browsing, as the argument develops, especially regarding wolves.
   B. The passage treats change primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over wolves are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about browsing are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how browsing should change if predators is altered, instead of assuming that change has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to wolves must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage implies that predators mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes change effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of wolves no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain browsing, in the setting discussed.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of wolves as a factor influencing change
   B. discussion of browsing as a factor influencing change, especially regarding predators.
   C. discussion of instrument dead time as a factor influencing change
   D. discussion of predators as a factor influencing change

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: When browsing pressure drops—either because elk numbers decline, because elk spend less time in vulnerable areas, or because harsh winters interact with predation— young shoots can survive long enough to grow above the reach of constant browsing.
   A. When browsing pressure drops—either because elk numbers decline. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   B. When browsing pressure drops—either because elk numbers decline. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of wolves guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in predators are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because comparability prevents wolves from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold predators constant while examining change.
   C. Because once change fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and predators can be ignored without changing conclusions about browsing.
   D. Because change directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding browsing.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | change | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | predators | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It proves wolves is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that browsing should be read alongside predators, because change alone does not settle what wolves means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This propagation is sometimes called a trophic cascade, but the phrase can invite oversimplification, as if one species toggles an ecosystem like a switch.
   A. the idea that In reality, cascades unfold through a series of linked causes that depend on where animals move, what they eat, and how plants respond to...
   B. the idea that When large predators disappear, the change is not confined to the predator itself, for the phenomenon at issue.
   C. the idea that It can propagate through prey behavior, vegetation, and even riverbanks, given the evidence cited, in the cases described.
   D. the idea that If vegetation fails to recover, perhaps the issue is not predator presence but lack of water or continued browsing by another herbivore
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of change lead to different conclusions about browsing.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses wolves, so debate over change is unnecessary noise, in the setting discussed, especially regarding predators.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of change and wolves should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to show that the term browsing belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
