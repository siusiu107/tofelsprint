Passage 0017: Predators, Prey Behavior, and Context-Dependent Trophic Cascades (Ecology)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 643)

When large predators disappear, the change is not confined to the predator itself. It can
propagate through prey behavior, vegetation, and even riverbanks. This propagation is
sometimes called a trophic cascade, but the phrase can invite oversimplification, as if one
species toggles an ecosystem like a switch. In reality, cascades unfold through a series of
linked causes that depend on where animals move, what they eat, and how plants respond to
browsing pressure over time.

Consider a landscape in which wolves have been absent for decades. Ungulates such as elk can
become abundant, but abundance alone does not explain vegetation change. Predators also
shape prey behavior. Without wolves, elk may spend more time in open valley bottoms where
grasses and willows are accessible and where escape is easy. With wolves present, those same
open areas can become risky, and elk may shift toward steeper terrain or move more
frequently. The behavioral shift changes where browsing is concentrated even if the total
number of elk changes only modestly.

Such spatial redistribution matters for plants that grow slowly. Willows and aspens in
valley bottoms can be repeatedly browsed at the same height, preventing them from escaping
into tall stems. When browsing pressure drops—either because elk numbers decline, because
elk spend less time in vulnerable areas, or because harsh winters interact with predation—
young shoots can survive long enough to grow above the reach of constant browsing. [A] Once
stems reach that threshold, a small difference in browsing can produce a large difference in
plant structure, because the plant’s own growth then begins to outrun herbivory.

The plant changes can then influence other species. Beaver colonies, for example, rely on
willow as food and as building material. If willow stands recover, beavers can expand,
building dams that slow streams and create wetlands. Those wetlands can support amphibians
and alter sediment deposition. Meanwhile, denser riparian vegetation can stabilize
riverbanks, reducing erosion and changing channel shape. [B] In this way, the predator’s
influence can be expressed in places where the predator never spends much time, because the
pathway runs through prey and plants.

Yet cascades rarely proceed cleanly. In some regions, elk may switch to other browse
species, shifting pressure rather than removing it. In others, human hunting can reduce elk
numbers, complicating the attribution of change to wolves alone. Climate also matters. A
series of dry years can limit willow recovery even if browsing declines, while wetter years
can accelerate growth. The cascade, therefore, is conditional: predators can open a door,
but weather and habitat determine how far the system walks through it. [C]

This conditionality is precisely why trophic cascades are scientifically useful. They
encourage ecologists to ask mechanistic questions: Did prey numbers change, prey behavior
change, or both? Did plants cross a height threshold? Did riparian soils retain enough
moisture to support regrowth? Answering such questions can prevent the story from becoming a
fable and can reveal where management interventions are likely to work. If vegetation fails
to recover, perhaps the issue is not predator presence but lack of water or continued
browsing by another herbivore.

Seen as a chain rather than as a slogan, a cascade connects predators to landscapes through
ordinary processes: risk, movement, feeding, growth, and engineering by other species. [D]
The lesson is neither that wolves are magical nor that they are irrelevant. It is that
ecosystems are networks in which removing or restoring a strong interaction can redirect
many smaller interactions, sometimes visibly, sometimes subtly, and always in ways that
depend on context.

Time also creates surprises. Even if browsing pressure drops quickly, trees may take years
to seed and establish, and a single flood can uproot young stems before they mature.
Meanwhile, when ungulates concentrate in safer uplands, their grazing can alter grassland
composition there, meaning that a “recovered” valley can coincide with a changed hillside.


Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author warn that the term “trophic cascade” can invite oversimplification?
   A. To argue that predators have no influence on ecosystems
   B. To emphasize that cascades depend on linked mechanisms and context rather than a single automatic switch
   C. To claim that vegetation changes occur only because of geology
   D. To suggest that prey behavior never changes in response to predators

2. [Vocabulary] The word “conditional” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. dependent on specific circumstances
   B. invisible
   C. permanent
   D. irrelevant

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The change is as much about fear as it is about appetite.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Factual] According to the passage, how can predators influence where browsing occurs even if elk numbers do not change dramatically?
   A. By altering elk movement and habitat use, shifting browsing pressure spatially
   B. By converting elk directly into beavers
   C. By increasing rainfall in valley bottoms
   D. By preventing plants from growing above browsing height

5. [Inference] What can be inferred about why a plant height threshold matters for willow recovery?
   A. Once stems grow beyond frequent browsing height, plant growth can outpace herbivory and structural change can accelerate
   B. Height thresholds prevent beavers from using willow as building material
   C. Tall stems always attract more browsing pressure from elk
   D. Plant thresholds matter only when wolves are absent

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as factors that can complicate cascades EXCEPT:
   A. human hunting
   B. climate variation such as dry or wet years
   C. prey switching to other browse species
   D. the alignment of exoplanet orbital planes

7. [Reference] In the passage, “those wetlands” refers to wetlands created by:
   A. wolves digging dens along streams
   B. beaver dams built after willow recovery
   C. elk migration routes through mountains
   D. erosion removing riverbanks

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains behavioral and numerical pathways from predators to plants, then traces consequences through beavers and rivers, and finally discusses why outcomes vary with context
   B. It lists animal names without causal connections
   C. It describes only wolf hunting tactics
   D. It provides a climate-only explanation for vegetation change

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that predators can “open a door” but context determines how far change goes?
   A. Predators can reduce browsing pressure, but plant recovery still depends on moisture, habitat, and other interacting forces
   B. Predators guarantee identical outcomes in every ecosystem
   C. Context does not matter once a predator returns
   D. Plants recover only through genetic mutation after predation

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Wolves cause vegetation to recover automatically, so climate and human hunting are irrelevant.
   B. The passage explains trophic cascades as linked mechanisms in which predators affect prey behavior and numbers, altering browsing and allowing vegetation and species like beavers to change landscapes, while emphasizing that outcomes vary with climate, hunting, and other contextual factors.
   C. Predators influence ecosystems only by eating plants directly.
   D. Elk always browse the same areas regardless of risk, so predator reintroduction has no effects.
