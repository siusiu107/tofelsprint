Passage 0034: Redlining and How Paper Maps Became Long-Term Inequality (Urban Sociology)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 626)

In many American cities, maps drawn nearly a century ago still cast a shadow. During the
1930s, federal and private institutions sought to standardize mortgage lending by rating
neighborhoods. Areas judged “risky” were often outlined in red on appraisal maps, a practice
that later became known as redlining. The ratings were not neutral descriptions of building
quality. They frequently incorporated racial composition and immigrant presence as signals
of instability. By redirecting capital away from certain blocks and toward others, these
maps helped create durable differences in wealth, housing conditions, and even health.

The mechanism begins with home ownership. When families can obtain mortgages on reasonable
terms, they can purchase homes, build equity, and pass resources to children. When mortgages
are scarce or predatory, renting becomes more common, equity accumulation slows, and
households have less buffer against unemployment or illness. [A] Redlining did not merely
reflect poverty; it helped produce it by shaping which households could access long-term
credit.

Disinvestment also affects the physical environment. Landlords in excluded areas, facing
lower property values and less access to renovation loans, may delay repairs. Housing stock
can deteriorate: leaky roofs, mold, lead paint, and faulty heating are not just
inconveniences; they are exposures. Children living with lead hazards can suffer cognitive
effects that affect schooling. Mold and dampness can aggravate asthma. Faulty insulation can
make homes uncomfortably hot in summer and cold in winter, stressing cardiovascular systems.
These are causal pathways through which financial decisions translate into bodily outcomes.

Infrastructure follows similar lines. Neighborhoods with low tax bases or low political
influence may receive fewer park investments, less tree cover, and more highway
construction. Highways built through redlined areas in the mid‑twentieth century increased
local air pollution and noise while also physically dividing communities. [B] Air pollution
elevates risks for respiratory disease, and chronic noise can disrupt sleep, compounding
stress. Over decades, such exposures can help explain why some neighborhoods show higher
rates of hypertension and shorter life expectancy than nearby districts.

The story is not only about harm; it is also about resilience and adaptation. Communities
developed mutual aid networks, church-based support systems, and local businesses that
served residents despite financial exclusion. Yet even resilience carries costs. When a
neighborhood must spend energy compensating for missing investment, it has less capacity to
pursue other goals. Moreover, the benefits of later reinvestment are often uneven. When a
previously excluded area becomes attractive to developers, rising rents can displace long-
term residents, converting renewed capital into another form of loss.

Redlining’s imprint can also persist through school funding and job access. If property
values remain lower, schools may have fewer resources. If transit routes bypass certain
districts, commuting to jobs can be harder. Economic opportunity is therefore shaped not
only by individual effort but by the built environment that channels time, money, and
exposure. [C] The neighborhood becomes an engine that either compounds advantage or
compounds disadvantage.

Recognizing these mechanisms has shifted how historians and urban scholars understand
inequality. The maps are artifacts, but their power lay in how institutions acted on them.
[D] A line drawn on paper became, through lending decisions, construction projects, and
landlord incentives, a line that separated futures. The lesson is sobering: when opportunity
is mediated through housing and infrastructure, discrimination can persist as concrete and
asphalt long after the original policy has been forgotten.

Studies of urban heat show that areas with fewer trees and more asphalt can become several
degrees warmer on summer days, and this additional heat burden often falls on the same
historically excluded neighborhoods.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Studies of urban heat show that areas with fewer trees and more asphalt can become several degrees warmer on summer days, and this additional heat burden often falls on the same historically excluded neighborhoods.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to areas and often
   B. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of excluded
   C. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across excluded
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys neighborhoods but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed often first, with areas serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats excluded as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   B. The passage explains neighborhoods by linking areas to often, and it shows why excluded changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   C. The passage presents often as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once areas is observed, competing explanations for neighborhoods collapse. It treats excluded as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding areas.
   D. The passage concedes that areas is often incomplete and concludes that neighborhoods cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since excluded overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of often with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how neighborhoods should change if excluded is altered, instead of assuming that areas has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to often must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage implies that excluded mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes areas effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of often no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain neighborhoods, especially regarding often, for the main claim of the text.
   C. The passage treats areas primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over often are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about neighborhoods are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in excluded, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of areas is enough to validate often for neighborhoods.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of instrument dead time as a factor influencing areas
   B. discussion of neighborhoods as a factor influencing areas, in the setting discussed.
   C. discussion of excluded as a factor influencing areas
   D. discussion of often as a factor influencing areas

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Studies of urban heat show that areas with fewer trees and more asphalt can become several degrees warmer on summer days, and this additional heat burden often falls on the same historically excluded neighborhoods.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, as the discussion implies, especially regarding fewer.
   B. Studies of urban heat show that areas with fewer trees and more asphalt can become several degrees warmer on summer days.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, for the phenomenon at issue.
   D. Studies of urban heat show that areas with fewer trees and more asphalt can become several degrees warmer on summer days.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of often guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in excluded are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because comparability prevents often from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold excluded constant while examining areas.
   C. Because once areas fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and excluded can be ignored without changing conclusions about neighborhoods.
   D. Because areas directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding neighborhoods.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | areas | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | excluded | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It proves often is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that neighborhoods should be read alongside excluded, because areas alone does not settle what often means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Studies of urban heat show that areas with fewer trees and more asphalt can become several degrees warmer on summer days, and this additional heat burden often falls on the same historically excluded neighborhoods.
   A. the idea that The lesson is sobering: when opportunity is mediated through housing and infrastructure, discrimination can persist as concrete and asphalt long after the original policy...
   B. the idea that [D] A line drawn on paper became, through lending decisions, construction projects, and landlord incentives, a line that separated futures, in the setting discussed.

   D. the idea that By redirecting capital away from certain blocks and toward others, these maps helped create durable differences in wealth, housing conditions, and even health...
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses often, so debate over areas is unnecessary noise, as framed by the author.
   B. to show that the term neighborhoods belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of areas and often should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of areas lead to different conclusions about neighborhoods.
