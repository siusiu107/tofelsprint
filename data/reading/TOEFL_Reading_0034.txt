Passage 0034: Redlining and How Paper Maps Became Long-Term Inequality (Urban Sociology)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 626)

In many American cities, maps drawn nearly a century ago still cast a shadow. During the
1930s, federal and private institutions sought to standardize mortgage lending by rating
neighborhoods. Areas judged “risky” were often outlined in red on appraisal maps, a practice
that later became known as redlining. The ratings were not neutral descriptions of building
quality. They frequently incorporated racial composition and immigrant presence as signals
of instability. By redirecting capital away from certain blocks and toward others, these
maps helped create durable differences in wealth, housing conditions, and even health.

The mechanism begins with home ownership. When families can obtain mortgages on reasonable
terms, they can purchase homes, build equity, and pass resources to children. When mortgages
are scarce or predatory, renting becomes more common, equity accumulation slows, and
households have less buffer against unemployment or illness. [A] Redlining did not merely
reflect poverty; it helped produce it by shaping which households could access long-term
credit.

Disinvestment also affects the physical environment. Landlords in excluded areas, facing
lower property values and less access to renovation loans, may delay repairs. Housing stock
can deteriorate: leaky roofs, mold, lead paint, and faulty heating are not just
inconveniences; they are exposures. Children living with lead hazards can suffer cognitive
effects that affect schooling. Mold and dampness can aggravate asthma. Faulty insulation can
make homes uncomfortably hot in summer and cold in winter, stressing cardiovascular systems.
These are causal pathways through which financial decisions translate into bodily outcomes.

Infrastructure follows similar lines. Neighborhoods with low tax bases or low political
influence may receive fewer park investments, less tree cover, and more highway
construction. Highways built through redlined areas in the mid‑twentieth century increased
local air pollution and noise while also physically dividing communities. [B] Air pollution
elevates risks for respiratory disease, and chronic noise can disrupt sleep, compounding
stress. Over decades, such exposures can help explain why some neighborhoods show higher
rates of hypertension and shorter life expectancy than nearby districts.

The story is not only about harm; it is also about resilience and adaptation. Communities
developed mutual aid networks, church-based support systems, and local businesses that
served residents despite financial exclusion. Yet even resilience carries costs. When a
neighborhood must spend energy compensating for missing investment, it has less capacity to
pursue other goals. Moreover, the benefits of later reinvestment are often uneven. When a
previously excluded area becomes attractive to developers, rising rents can displace long-
term residents, converting renewed capital into another form of loss.

Redlining’s imprint can also persist through school funding and job access. If property
values remain lower, schools may have fewer resources. If transit routes bypass certain
districts, commuting to jobs can be harder. Economic opportunity is therefore shaped not
only by individual effort but by the built environment that channels time, money, and
exposure. [C] The neighborhood becomes an engine that either compounds advantage or
compounds disadvantage.

Recognizing these mechanisms has shifted how historians and urban scholars understand
inequality. The maps are artifacts, but their power lay in how institutions acted on them.
[D] A line drawn on paper became, through lending decisions, construction projects, and
landlord incentives, a line that separated futures. The lesson is sobering: when opportunity
is mediated through housing and infrastructure, discrimination can persist as concrete and
asphalt long after the original policy has been forgotten.

Studies of urban heat show that areas with fewer trees and more asphalt can become several
degrees warmer on summer days, and this additional heat burden often falls on the same
historically excluded neighborhoods.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Access to stable credit, in this view, is a pathway to stability itself.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Vocabulary] The word “buffer” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a protective cushion against hardship
   B. a loan interest rate
   C. a neighborhood boundary
   D. a highway noise source

3. [Factual] According to the passage, which is one way disinvestment can affect health?
   A. Deteriorating housing conditions can increase exposures such as lead or mold
   B. It automatically increases tree cover in excluded areas
   C. It eliminates air pollution by reducing traffic
   D. It guarantees that residents become homeowners

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why later reinvestment can still produce “loss” for long-term residents?
   A. Rising rents can displace residents, so renewed capital does not necessarily benefit those who endured exclusion
   B. New parks always increase noise levels
   C. Mortgage access becomes impossible in all cases
   D. Schools lose funding when property values rise

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as consequences linked to redlining EXCEPT:
   A. reduced access to mortgages
   B. deteriorating housing stock
   C. highway construction through certain neighborhoods
   D. deep-ocean oxygen ventilation

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention highways built through redlined areas?
   A. To illustrate how infrastructure decisions concentrated pollution and noise in certain neighborhoods, affecting health and cohesion
   B. To argue that highways were designed to improve sleep
   C. To claim that all neighborhoods received equal investment
   D. To show that redlining increased mortgage availability

7. [Reference] In the passage, “these are causal pathways” refers to the idea that:
   A. financial disinvestment can lead to specific exposures that affect bodies over time
   B. health outcomes determine mortgage interest rates directly
   C. air pollution causes redlining maps to be drawn
   D. neighborhoods are unaffected by infrastructure

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains redlining’s historical origin, then traces mechanisms through credit, housing conditions, and infrastructure before noting resilience and long-term opportunity effects
   B. It lists cities in alphabetical order
   C. It focuses only on mortgage math without social effects
   D. It describes health outcomes without discussing housing

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that redlining “helped produce” poverty rather than simply reflecting it?
   A. By limiting access to long-term credit, redlining constrained wealth building and shaped neighborhood trajectories
   B. Redlining occurred only after poverty had already ended
   C. Poverty caused maps to disappear, reversing the effect
   D. Redlining increased equity accumulation in excluded areas

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Redlining improved housing conditions by distributing loans evenly across cities.
   B. The passage explains how redlining redirected mortgage credit and investment, contributing to persistent wealth gaps and health disparities through housing deterioration and infrastructure exposure, while also noting community resilience and the complicated effects of later redevelopment.
   C. Neighborhood health differences are caused entirely by climate and not by investment patterns.
   D. Highways were built mainly to reduce pollution in redlined areas.
