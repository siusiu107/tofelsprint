Passage 0718: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 771)

When adoption is measured in aggregates, one sees why researchers have treated school-
quality gradients as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Even if audit studies in housing markets can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Not until analysts began
combining audit studies in housing markets with cross-site comparisons did claims about
residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which school-quality gradients could be explained in more than one way
largely because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining often co-vary
with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. Even though the first model can fit one dataset
extremely well, the passage insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not
assumed. it highlights how path dependence from historical redlining can shift baselines,
altering whether school-quality gradients is even comparable across cases, which helps
explain why means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation. If path dependence
from historical redlining is changed while the nominal driver remains constant, one should
expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. The decisive factor is
methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as the lesson of
residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The author implies that
replication is informative only when protocols are comparable. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same
observation—school-quality gradients—must be paired with tests that change the conditions
under which it appears. [B] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured
with what is inferred. Whereas popular summaries treat school-quality gradients as an
endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. [C] The
author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. [D] At first
glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. Using audit
studies in housing markets under stable conditions, the argument reframes the issue so that
one frequently cited case from large U.S. metropolitan areas appeared to support the direct-
readout view. Though the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis
showed that small shifts in path dependence from historical redlining altered the baseline
enough to mute or mimic school-quality gradients. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, which forces analysts to admit that illustrates why boundary conditions must be
specified before generalization is attempted. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality
across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
It is the apparent regularity of school-quality gradients that drives the first
interpretation: school-quality gradients is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. If
school-quality gradients is uniquely produced by one causal pathway is granted, then
observations from large U.S. metropolitan areas would be transferable, and disagreement
would be largely technical. The issue is not the caveat that path dependence from historical
redlining might reproduce the same pattern; it is that the literature is full of such
claims. Never before analysts began combining audit studies in housing markets with cross-
site comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about residential segregation and
the persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break
degeneracies in which school-quality gradients could be explained in more than one way
because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining often co-vary with the
driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than
a stylistic choice, which changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this
sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label. In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that
the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into
the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: Never before analysts began combining audit studies in housing markets with cross-site comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in post-industrial cities and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates informational asymmetries in housing search.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on mobility tracking with administrative records simple.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. spatial autocorrelation analysis
   B. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   C. school-quality gradients
   D. a list of Olympic medal counts

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In short, the passage treats methodological humility as a strength, not as an admission of ignorance.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **tentative** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [A] The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols are comparable.
   A. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   B. not certain
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because informational asymmetries in housing search dominates all evidence
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like audit studies in housing markets are needed

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.
   A. spatial autocorrelation analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. wealth accumulation gaps specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. path dependence from historical redlining alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. The passage implies that spatial autocorrelation analysis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from informational asymmetries in housing search is impossible.
   B. it prevents mobility constraints across space from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control informational asymmetries in housing search
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if spatial autocorrelation analysis produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. Because mobility constraints across space appears, the mechanism must be unique, so informational asymmetries in housing search can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like informational asymmetries in housing search make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting mobility tracking with administrative records as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats mobility tracking with administrative records as a historical curiosity and does not discuss school-quality gradients or informational asymmetries in housing search. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that informational asymmetries in housing search is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using mobility tracking with administrative records are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that school-quality gradients is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how informational asymmetries in housing search can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from large U.S. metropolitan areas. Finally, it maintains that tests combining mobility tracking with administrative records with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The passage treats mobility constraints across space as a confounder and informational asymmetries in housing search as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The passage implies that rapidly growing Sun Belt regions is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where quasi-experimental policy evaluation constrains informational asymmetries in housing search
   D. The discussion suggests that informational asymmetries in housing search is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

9. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that school-quality gradients is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when informational asymmetries in housing search can mimic school-quality gradients.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving longitudinal panel data.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using longitudinal panel data.
