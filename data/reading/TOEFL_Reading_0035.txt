Passage 0035: The Great Vowel Shift and Why English Spelling Preserves Older Sounds (Linguistics)
=================================================================================================
(Word count: 616)

When English speakers today pronounce “time” and “meet,” they rarely think of their vowels
as historical artifacts. Yet the sound system of English has undergone dramatic
rearrangements, and one of the most consequential was the Great Vowel Shift, a broad change
in the pronunciation of long vowels that unfolded roughly between the fifteenth and
eighteenth centuries. The shift did not occur in one night, nor did it operate like a
switch. It was a chain reaction in which one sound change created pressures that nudged
other sounds into new positions.

To understand the shift, imagine the vowel space as a crowded room. Vowels are distinguished
by tongue height and frontness: a high front vowel like the one in “meet” is produced with
the tongue raised near the front of the mouth, while a low vowel like the one in “father” is
produced with the tongue lower. Long vowels in Middle English occupied different regions of
this space than they do now. During the Great Vowel Shift, many long vowels moved upward,
and those already high often became diphthongs—gliding vowels—because they had nowhere
higher to go. The vowel in “time,” for instance, likely began closer to a pure “ee” sound
and then developed a glide toward the modern “ai.” [A] The shift can be seen as a sequence
of pushes and pulls: when one vowel vacates a space, another can move into it, avoiding
confusion.

Why would speakers participate in such a change without intending to? Sound change spreads
through social networks. If a prestigious group adopts a slightly different pronunciation,
others may imitate it, and the imitation can be imperfect, creating further variation.
Migration and urbanization in late medieval England brought speakers of different dialects
into closer contact, increasing opportunities for such diffusion. Printing did not cause the
shift, but it helped freeze spelling at a time when pronunciation was still moving. As a
result, modern English contains many spellings that look “illogical” only because they
represent older pronunciations.

The shift also helps explain why English dialects differ today. Some varieties of English
completed certain vowel changes more fully than others. In parts of Scotland, for example,
the vowel in “house” can differ from southern British and many American pronunciations,
reflecting divergent outcomes in the historical chain. [B] Even within a single city, vowel
systems can continue to drift, producing new shifts that echo the logic of the earlier one:
crowded vowel spaces invite reorganization.

The consequences extend beyond phonetics. Because spelling stabilized while vowels shifted,
learners face a mismatch between letters and sounds. Historical linguists use the mismatch
as evidence, comparing rhymes in poetry, spellings in letters, and descriptions by
contemporary grammarians to infer earlier pronunciations. Yet the evidence is not limited to
scholars. Speakers still carry traces of historical changes in their mouths, and those
traces shape judgments of accent and identity. A vowel can signal region, class, or
affiliation, sometimes more powerfully than vocabulary does.

Moreover, the Great Vowel Shift illustrates a general property of language: systems adjust.
A language is not a bag of independent words; it is an interlocking pattern of contrasts.
When one contrast weakens, others may sharpen. When one sound moves, the system may respond
by moving another sound to preserve distinctiveness. [C] The shift, therefore, is not a
curiosity for museums; it is an example of how social imitation and structural pressures can
combine to remodel an everyday tool.

Seen from this perspective, the “weirdness” of English spelling is not a defect but a fossil
record. [D] Each silent letter and unexpected vowel hints at a pronunciation that once made
sense, before the room of vowels rearranged itself and left written forms behind as enduring
footprints.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The vowel in “time,” for instance, likely began closer to a pure “ee” sound and then developed a glide toward the modern “ai.” [A] The shift can be seen as a sequence of pushes and pulls: when one vowel vacates a space, another can move into it, avoiding confusion.
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to shift and vowels
   C. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across english
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of english

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys vowel but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed vowels first, with shift serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats english as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   B. The passage explains vowel by linking shift to vowels, and it shows why english changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   C. The passage concedes that shift is often incomplete and concludes that vowel cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since english overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of vowels with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   D. The passage presents vowels as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once shift is observed, competing explanations for vowel collapse. It treats english as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding english.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how vowel should change if english is altered, instead of assuming that shift has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to vowels must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage implies that english mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes shift effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of vowels no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain vowel, especially regarding shift, especially regarding vowels, especially regarding sound.
   C. The passage treats shift primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over vowels are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about vowel are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in english, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of shift is enough to validate vowels for vowel.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of epigenetic imprinting as a factor influencing shift
   B. discussion of vowel as a factor influencing shift
   C. discussion of vowels as a factor influencing shift, in the examples provided.
   D. discussion of english as a factor influencing shift

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: The vowel in “time,” for instance, likely began closer to a pure “ee” sound and then developed a glide toward the modern “ai.” [A] The shift can be seen as a sequence of pushes and pulls: when one vowel vacates a space, another can move into it, avoiding confusion.
   A. The vowel in “time. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   D. The vowel in “time. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents vowels from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold english constant while examining shift.
   B. Because the presence of vowels guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in english are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because once shift fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and english can be ignored without changing conclusions about vowel.
   D. Because shift directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding vowel.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | shift | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | english | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It proves vowels is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that vowel should be read alongside english, because shift alone does not settle what vowels means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: When English speakers today pronounce “time” and “meet,” they rarely think of their vowels as historical artifacts.
   A. the preceding claim that vowel functions as a direct measurement of vowels
   B. the preceding claim that shift is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   C. the preceding claim that english alone explains the outcome of vowel
   D. the preceding claim about how shift is interpreted in relation to vowels

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of shift lead to different conclusions about vowel.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses vowels, so debate over shift is unnecessary noise, especially regarding english.
   C. to show that the term vowel belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, in the cases described.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of shift and vowels should be abandoned altogether.
