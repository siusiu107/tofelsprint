Passage 0035: The Great Vowel Shift and Why English Spelling Preserves Older Sounds (Linguistics)
=================================================================================================
(Word count: 616)

When English speakers today pronounce “time” and “meet,” they rarely think of their vowels
as historical artifacts. Yet the sound system of English has undergone dramatic
rearrangements, and one of the most consequential was the Great Vowel Shift, a broad change
in the pronunciation of long vowels that unfolded roughly between the fifteenth and
eighteenth centuries. The shift did not occur in one night, nor did it operate like a
switch. It was a chain reaction in which one sound change created pressures that nudged
other sounds into new positions.

To understand the shift, imagine the vowel space as a crowded room. Vowels are distinguished
by tongue height and frontness: a high front vowel like the one in “meet” is produced with
the tongue raised near the front of the mouth, while a low vowel like the one in “father” is
produced with the tongue lower. Long vowels in Middle English occupied different regions of
this space than they do now. During the Great Vowel Shift, many long vowels moved upward,
and those already high often became diphthongs—gliding vowels—because they had nowhere
higher to go. The vowel in “time,” for instance, likely began closer to a pure “ee” sound
and then developed a glide toward the modern “ai.” [A] The shift can be seen as a sequence
of pushes and pulls: when one vowel vacates a space, another can move into it, avoiding
confusion.

Why would speakers participate in such a change without intending to? Sound change spreads
through social networks. If a prestigious group adopts a slightly different pronunciation,
others may imitate it, and the imitation can be imperfect, creating further variation.
Migration and urbanization in late medieval England brought speakers of different dialects
into closer contact, increasing opportunities for such diffusion. Printing did not cause the
shift, but it helped freeze spelling at a time when pronunciation was still moving. As a
result, modern English contains many spellings that look “illogical” only because they
represent older pronunciations.

The shift also helps explain why English dialects differ today. Some varieties of English
completed certain vowel changes more fully than others. In parts of Scotland, for example,
the vowel in “house” can differ from southern British and many American pronunciations,
reflecting divergent outcomes in the historical chain. [B] Even within a single city, vowel
systems can continue to drift, producing new shifts that echo the logic of the earlier one:
crowded vowel spaces invite reorganization.

The consequences extend beyond phonetics. Because spelling stabilized while vowels shifted,
learners face a mismatch between letters and sounds. Historical linguists use the mismatch
as evidence, comparing rhymes in poetry, spellings in letters, and descriptions by
contemporary grammarians to infer earlier pronunciations. Yet the evidence is not limited to
scholars. Speakers still carry traces of historical changes in their mouths, and those
traces shape judgments of accent and identity. A vowel can signal region, class, or
affiliation, sometimes more powerfully than vocabulary does.

Moreover, the Great Vowel Shift illustrates a general property of language: systems adjust.
A language is not a bag of independent words; it is an interlocking pattern of contrasts.
When one contrast weakens, others may sharpen. When one sound moves, the system may respond
by moving another sound to preserve distinctiveness. [C] The shift, therefore, is not a
curiosity for museums; it is an example of how social imitation and structural pressures can
combine to remodel an everyday tool.

Seen from this perspective, the “weirdness” of English spelling is not a defect but a fossil
record. [D] Each silent letter and unexpected vowel hints at a pronunciation that once made
sense, before the room of vowels rearranged itself and left written forms behind as enduring
footprints.


Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, what is one major feature of the Great Vowel Shift?
   A. Many long vowels moved upward in the vowel space, and the highest often became diphthongs
   B. Consonants disappeared from English entirely
   C. Spelling changed rapidly to match pronunciation
   D. All dialects changed in exactly the same way

2. [Vocabulary] The phrase “fossil record” in the passage most nearly suggests that English spelling:
   A. preserves traces of earlier pronunciations
   B. is designed to mislead learners
   C. changes faster than speech
   D. contains no historical information

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: A crowded system tends to resist overlap, because overlap threatens comprehension.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why printing contributed to the modern spelling–sound mismatch?
   A. It stabilized spellings while speech continued to change, so letters often reflect older sounds
   B. It forced everyone to pronounce vowels identically
   C. It eliminated dialect contact by reducing travel
   D. It created new vowels by adding ink to pages

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author compare vowel space to a “crowded room”?
   A. To help readers visualize how vowels can shift positions to avoid confusion and maintain contrasts
   B. To claim that speech is produced in the lungs only
   C. To argue that vowels are random and unpatterned
   D. To show that only poetry changes pronunciation

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as evidence for reconstructing earlier pronunciations EXCEPT:
   A. rhymes in poetry
   B. spellings in personal letters
   C. descriptions by contemporary grammarians
   D. GPS measurements of coastal uplift

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the historical chain” refers to:
   A. a sequence of linked vowel changes whose outcomes differed across regions
   B. a set of legal chains used for printing
   C. a chain of consonant deletions
   D. an unchanging list of spelling rules

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces the Great Vowel Shift, explains it with a vowel-space model, then discusses social diffusion, spelling consequences, dialect variation, and the broader lesson of systemic adjustment
   B. It lists vowel symbols without explanation
   C. It argues that English never changes
   D. It describes printing technology only

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that language is “an interlocking pattern of contrasts”?
   A. Sounds function as a system; when one moves, others may shift to preserve distinct meanings
   B. Each word changes independently without affecting others
   C. Only spelling determines pronunciation changes
   D. Contrasts disappear whenever printing spreads

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The Great Vowel Shift was a single event caused entirely by printing presses.
   B. The passage explains the Great Vowel Shift as a gradual, linked reorganization of long vowels driven by social diffusion and structural pressure in vowel systems, and shows how the timing of spelling stabilization created lasting mismatches that still signal identity and preserve historical traces.
   C. English spelling is illogical because vowels never changed historically.
   D. Dialect differences prove that vowels cannot be modeled systematically.
