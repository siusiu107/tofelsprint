Passage 0315: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 698)

In operando measurement campaigns, researchers found that researchers have treated rate
enhancement as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
Admittedly, surface microscopy can make the pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than
rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike laboratory single-crystal studies. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because
catalyst deactivation shifted the baseline in different directions across sites, which is
why replication matters. Not treating rate enhancement as a self-sufficient conclusion, but
the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense, surface-
mediated catalysis on pt is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst
deactivation. by comparing cases in which surface microscopy constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

Seldom, prior to analysts began combining surface microscopy with cross-site comparisons,
did investigators concede that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which rate enhancement could be explained in more than one way
because, as the author notes, confounders like catalyst deactivation often co-vary with the
driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than
a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The passage returns to this
point to clarify what counts as evidence. Were one wishes to move from description to
explanation to fail, then the same observation—rate enhancement—must be paired with tests
that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The author suggests that the same
evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ. Whereas popular summaries treat
rate enhancement as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point
for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. [C] The discussion makes
clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. [D] The passage highlights that
mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst deactivation did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which surface microscopy constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value
of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense,
metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Despite the fact that the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which rate enhancement is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | surface microscopy | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | selectivity shifts | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | catalyst deactivation | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It makes support interactions irrelevant.
   B. It proves structure-sensitive activity is unique.
   C. It replaces DFT surface modeling with intuition.
   D. May not generalize across contexts

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that rate enhancement is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how support interactions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from automotive catalytic converters. Finally, it maintains that tests combining surface microscopy with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   B. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like support interactions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting surface microscopy as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats surface microscopy as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rate enhancement or support interactions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because rate enhancement uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that support interactions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using surface microscopy are unnecessary.

9. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. it prevents poisoning by CO from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control support interactions
   B. Because support interactions co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. Since poisoning by CO is observed in electrochemical interfaces, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once poisoning by CO is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   B. The discussion suggests that catalyst deactivation is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The passage treats structure-sensitive activity as a confounder and catalyst deactivation as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where DFT surface modeling constrains catalyst deactivation
