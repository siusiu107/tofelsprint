Passage 0907: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 726)

From a cognitive-control perspective, researchers found that researchers have treated
selective memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization. behavioral priming designs can make the pattern look
unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on measurement reactivity, the argument
reframes the issue so that many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized selective
memory for supporting evidence as a signature, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ. The passage argues that this shift mattered
for how evidence from workplace decision settings was generalized because local conditions
can change which processes generate selective memory for supporting evidence. In this sense,
post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Using behavioral priming designs under stable conditions, the interpretation shifts, and one
frequently cited case from workplace decision settings appeared to support the direct-
readout view. [A] The argument hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation.
While it is true that the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis
showed that small shifts in measurement reactivity altered the baseline enough to mute or
mimic selective memory for supporting evidence. [B] This point forces the reader to consider
how confounders enter the pipeline. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which
forces analysts to admit that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted. [C] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are
tested. [D] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity,
does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which behavioral priming designs constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Granted that a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from description to
explanation to fail, then the same observation—selective memory for supporting evidence—must
be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an endpoint, the passage treats
it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

Hardly had analysts began combining behavioral priming designs with cross-site comparisons
occurred when claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which selective memory for supporting evidence could be explained in
more than one way because confounders like measurement reactivity often co-vary with the
driver, which is why replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors
became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether
two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record
can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Admittedly, the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; nevertheless, the result
is a framework in which selective memory for supporting evidence is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using meta-analytic synthesis.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when cultural norms about consistency can mimic shifted confidence judgments.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away cultural norms about consistency, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The passage suggests that shifted confidence judgments is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that shifted confidence judgments is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how self-concept threat can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal attitude surveys with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   B. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that self-concept threat is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal attitude surveys are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal attitude surveys as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifted confidence judgments or self-concept threat. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like self-concept threat make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal attitude surveys as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

3. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | implicit association tests | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | shifted confidence judgments | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | public versus private commitment | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Samples only part of the system
   B. It proves shifted confidence judgments is unique.
   C. It replaces choice-induced preference paradigms with intuition.
   D. Co-varies with the driver of interest

   A. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   B. a list of Olympic medal counts
   C. longitudinal attitude surveys
   D. increased liking for chosen options

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **persistent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because self-concept threat dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like longitudinal attitude surveys are needed
   C. lasting
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. self-concept threat alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. behavioral priming designs as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

7. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if longitudinal attitude surveys produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. The passage implies that longitudinal attitude surveys directly measures causes, meaning confounding from measurement reactivity is impossible.
   D. Because measurement reactivity co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on implicit association tests simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates public versus private commitment.

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'post-choice attitude change' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   B. The discussion suggests that self-concept threat is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The passage implies that cross-national survey samples is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal attitude surveys constrains self-concept threat
