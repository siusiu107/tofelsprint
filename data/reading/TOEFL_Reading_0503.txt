Passage 0503: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 710)

Despite elegant mechanistic cartoons, the passage argues that researchers have treated
selectivity shifts as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
Even if surface microscopy can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues
that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike automotive catalytic converters. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely
because facet dependence shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. the
author therefore separates detection from interpretation—not treating selectivity shifts as
a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet dependence did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which surface microscopy constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be dramatic, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet dependence was it clear
that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] That point
is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows. by comparing cases in which surface
microscopy constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design
over isolated exemplars. [B] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors
to be discarded. To be sure, a single case can be dramatic, yet the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] The
author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. [D] The author shifts from narrative
to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed
reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—selectivity shifts—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat selectivity shifts as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it
as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder to
interpret without assumptions.

Only after analysts began combining surface microscopy with cross-site comparisons did the
earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about heterogeneous catalysis on
platinum surfaces stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which selectivity shifts could be
explained in more than one way in part because confounders like facet dependence often co-
vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Even though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result
is a framework in which selectivity shifts is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats microkinetic modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rate enhancement or facet dependence. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like facet dependence make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting microkinetic modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that rate enhancement is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how facet dependence can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from electrochemical interfaces. Finally, it maintains that tests combining microkinetic modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   D. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because rate enhancement uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that facet dependence is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using microkinetic modeling are unnecessary.

2. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet dependence was it clear that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
   A. facet dependence alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. selectivity shifts specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. temperature-programmed desorption as a device rather than as an analytic approach

3. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if DFT surface modeling produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. Because catalyst deactivation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. Because selectivity shifts appears, the mechanism must be unique, so catalyst deactivation can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. it prevents selectivity shifts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control catalyst deactivation

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **coherent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Even though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which selectivity shifts is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like in situ spectroscopy are needed
   B. well organized
   C. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because adsorbate coverage effects dominates all evidence

5. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. The author argues that in situ spectroscopy should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The discussion suggests that adsorbate coverage effects is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where in situ spectroscopy constrains adsorbate coverage effects
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'metal-surface catalytic conversion' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.

7. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when adsorbate coverage effects can mimic rate enhancement.
   B. The passage suggests that rate enhancement is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving surface microscopy.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using surface microscopy.
