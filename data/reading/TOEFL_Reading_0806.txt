Passage 0806: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 736)

In surface-science experiments, one sees why researchers have treated rate enhancement as
the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Although in situ
spectroscopy can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain
why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Using in situ spectroscopy under stable conditions, the author treats the complication as
diagnostic, so one frequently cited case from industrial hydrogenation reactors appeared to
support the direct-readout view. [A] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a
disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Despite the fact that the original fit looked
visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in catalyst
deactivation altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic rate enhancement. [B] This is why
the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred. the passage treats
this episode as diagnostic, something that illustrates why boundary conditions must be
specified before generalization is attempted. [C] This becomes a pivot point where the
earlier interpretation is narrowed. [D] The author uses the detour to show why a different
metric would lead to a different conclusion. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only after analysts began combining in situ spectroscopy with cross-site comparisons did the
earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about heterogeneous catalysis on
platinum surfaces stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which rate enhancement could be explained
in more than one way in part because confounders like catalyst deactivation often co-vary
with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst deactivation
occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which in situ spectroscopy constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Granted that a single case can be dramatic, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation
holds, then the same observation—rate enhancement—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat rate enhancement as an
endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental
or observational contrasts in another.

Only by analysts began combining in situ spectroscopy with cross-site comparisons was the
field forced to accept that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which rate enhancement could be explained in more than one way
because confounders like catalyst deactivation often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a
move that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, metal-surface
catalytic conversion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Even though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong,
the result is a framework in which rate enhancement is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selectivity shifts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates catalyst deactivation.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in automotive catalytic converters and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on microkinetic modeling simple.

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like adsorbate coverage effects make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting surface microscopy as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats surface microscopy as a historical curiosity and does not discuss structure-sensitive activity or adsorbate coverage effects. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that structure-sensitive activity is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how adsorbate coverage effects can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from industrial hydrogenation reactors. Finally, it maintains that tests combining surface microscopy with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   D. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because structure-sensitive activity uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that adsorbate coverage effects is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using surface microscopy are unnecessary.

7. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The author argues that surface microscopy should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The passage treats rate enhancement as a confounder and adsorbate coverage effects as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The passage implies that industrial hydrogenation reactors is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where surface microscopy constrains adsorbate coverage effects

8. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conspicuous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because adsorbate coverage effects dominates all evidence
   B. easy to notice
   C. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like temperature-programmed desorption are needed

9. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. The passage implies that DFT surface modeling directly measures causes, meaning confounding from facet dependence is impossible.
   B. Because selectivity shifts appears, the mechanism must be unique, so facet dependence can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. it prevents selectivity shifts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control facet dependence
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if DFT surface modeling produces a tight fit on one dataset.

10. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving in situ spectroscopy.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when adsorbate coverage effects can mimic poisoning by CO.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using in situ spectroscopy.
   D. The passage suggests that poisoning by CO is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
