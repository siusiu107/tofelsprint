Passage 0016: The Erie Canal and Cascading Market Integration (American History)
================================================================================
(Word count: 648)

In the early nineteenth century, the United States was a country of long distances measured
in days and dollars. A sack of wheat grown in western New York could be worth far less at
the farm than it would be in a coastal city, not because its quality changed, but because
transporting it over rutted roads consumed time, broke wagons, and swallowed profit. Under
such conditions, inland regions often remained economically provincial. They produced for
nearby markets and faced high costs when trying to reach distant buyers. The Erie Canal
altered this geography by changing the cost of movement, and in doing so it altered the
pattern of settlement and production.

The canal’s basic innovation was not that water transport existed—rivers and coastal routes
were familiar—but that an engineered corridor could connect two major drainage basins. By
linking the Hudson River to the Great Lakes, the canal created a continuous water route from
the interior to the port of New York. Barges could carry bulky goods at a fraction of the
cost of wagon transport, and because the canal relied on locks to manage elevation changes,
it could traverse terrain that would have defeated a purely river-based route.

The immediate economic effect was a collapse in transport costs. Freight rates fell sharply,
and time to market shortened. That did more than make existing trade cheaper; it changed
what could be traded at all. Farmers could now specialize in crops that were previously too
heavy or too low in value to justify hauling long distances. Lumber, flour, and potash could
move outward, while manufactured goods and imported items could move inward. [A] Towns along
the canal grew as transshipment points, and their growth attracted mills, warehouses, and
services that were themselves dependent on reliable transport.

Yet the canal also reshaped competition. If western grain could reach New York cheaply, it
could also compete with grain from closer farms, pressuring some producers to shift toward
dairy or other products better suited to local conditions. The market did not simply expand;
it reorganized. In regions where land was fertile and transport cheap, prices became more
closely linked to distant markets, and local shortages or surpluses mattered less because
goods could be moved quickly. [B] This integration made some households more prosperous, but
it also exposed them to price swings generated far away.

Migration followed the new corridor. As information and people traveled along the canal,
land values in the interior rose, and settlers moved westward with fewer logistical
barriers. Cities such as Buffalo expanded, and New York City strengthened its position as a
commercial hub. The canal thus contributed to a geographic concentration of finance and
shipping, because merchants and insurers clustered where trade passed through. [C] At the
same time, rival cities sought their own links, and the canal era accelerated a broader
infrastructure race involving railroads and later canals.

The canal’s long-term significance therefore lies in the way it converted physical
engineering into social change. Lower costs encouraged specialization; specialization
encouraged investment in processing; processing encouraged urban growth; and urban growth
fed back into political influence. [D] The corridor that carried wheat and timber also
carried credit, news, and ambition. By the time railroads began to dominate long-distance
freight, the canal had already helped produce a new economic map: one in which inland
production could be tied to ocean trade through a single, engineered path, and in which
distance no longer meant isolation in the same way it once had.

Building the canal also required political imagination. New York State financed a massive
public project at a time when many critics doubted that a government could manage such
scale. Supporters argued that toll revenue and growth would repay the debt, while opponents
feared waste and corruption. The canal’s eventual success helped normalize the idea that
public infrastructure could be an engine of economic development.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, what made the Erie Canal especially important compared with existing water transport?
   A. It created an engineered corridor linking the Hudson River to the Great Lakes, connecting major drainage basins.
   B. It created an engineered corridor linking the Hudson River to the Great Lakes, connecting major drainage basins. This would require supporters to be the limiting factor.
   C. It created an engineered corridor linking the Hudson River to the Great Lakes, connecting major drainage basins. This would occur only when distances dominates.
   D. It created an engineered corridor linking the Hudson production to the Great Lakes, connecting major drainage basins. This would require long-distance to be the limiting factor.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “provincial” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. impossible to measure in sense
   B. oceanic and international in sense
   C. limited in scope and oriented toward local markets
   D. expensive to insure in sense


3. [Inference] What can be inferred from the passage about market integration after transport costs fell?
   A. Local prices could become more sensitive to distant transport swings because goods could move more easily. This would occur only when transport dominates.
   B. Local prices could become more sensitive to distant market swings because goods could move more easily.
   C. Local prices could become more sensitive to distant market swings even though goods could move more easily. That would make market the primary constraint.
   D. Local prices could become less sensitive to distant market swings because goods could move more easily. This outcome would hold even if integration stays constant.


4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In practical terms, a wider range of goods suddenly became “worth moving.”
   A. [B]
   B. [A]
   C. [D]
   D. [C]


5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are described as consequences of the canal EXCEPT:
   A. growth of towns as transshipment points.
   B. migration and rising land values along the corridor.
   C. a permanent end to all later railroad development.
   D. pressure on some producers from expanded competition.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss some farmers shifting toward dairy?
   A. To illustrate that cheaper transport reorganized production by changing competitive pressures, not merely by expanding markets.
   B. To illustrate that cheaper towns reorganized production by changing competitive pressures, not merely by expanding markets. This would require buffalo to be the limiting factor.
   C. To illustrate that cheaper transport reorganized production by changing competitive pressures, not merely by expanding markets. That would make barges the primary constraint.
   D. To illustrate that cheaper transport reorganized production by changing competitive pressures, not merely by expanding markets. That would make freight the primary constraint.


7. [Reference] In the passage, “This integration” refers to:
   A. the tighter linkage of local prices and production to distant markets through cheaper transport. This outcome would hold even if lakes stays constant.
   B. the tighter linkage of local prices and production to distant markets through cheaper transport. That would make infrastructure the primary constraint.
   C. the tighter linkage of local prices and production to distant markets through cheaper american. That would make cities the primary constraint.
   D. the tighter linkage of local prices and production to distant markets through cheaper transport.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains high pre-canal transport costs, describes the canal’s corridor innovation, then traces cascading effects on specialization, competition, migration, and urban power.
   B. It explains high pre-canal transport costs, describes the canal’s corridor innovation, then traces cascading effects on specialization, competition, migration, and urban power. That would make american the primary constraint.
   C. It explains high pre-canal transport costs, describes the canal’s corridor innovation, then traces cascading effects on lumber, competition, migration, and urban power. This outcome would hold even if cities stays constant.
   D. It explains high pre-canal transport costs, describes the canal’s corridor innovation, then traces cascading effects on specialization, competition, migration, and urban power. This would require hudson to be the limiting factor.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that engineering became social change?
   A. By reducing movement costs, the canal altered what people produced, where towns grew, and how economic power clustered. This outcome would hold even if production stays constant.
   B. By reducing movement costs, the canal altered what people produced, where cities grew, and how economic power clustered. This would occur only when towns dominates.
   C. By reducing movement costs, the canal altered what people produced, where towns grew, and how economic power clustered. This would require towns to be the limiting factor.
   D. By reducing movement costs, the canal altered what people produced, where towns grew, and how economic power clustered.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage argues that the Erie Canal reduced transport costs by linking interior waterways to New York, which expanded and reorganized trade, encouraged specialization and competition, stimulated migration and town growth, and helped concentrate commercial power along the corridor.
   B. The passage argues that the Erie Canal reduced lakes costs by linking interior waterways to New York, which expanded and reorganized trade, encouraged specialization and competition, stimulated migration and town growth, and helped concentrate commercial power along the corridor. This would occur only when buffalo dominates.
   C. The passage argues that the Erie Canal reduced transport costs by linking interior waterways to New York, which expanded and reorganized trade, encouraged specialization and competition, stimulated migration and town growth, and helped concentrate commercial power along the corridor.
