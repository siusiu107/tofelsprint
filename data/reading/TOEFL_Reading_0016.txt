Passage 0016: The Erie Canal and Cascading Market Integration (American History)
================================================================================
(Word count: 648)

In the early nineteenth century, the United States was a country of long distances measured
in days and dollars. A sack of wheat grown in western New York could be worth far less at
the farm than it would be in a coastal city, not because its quality changed, but because
transporting it over rutted roads consumed time, broke wagons, and swallowed profit. Under
such conditions, inland regions often remained economically provincial. They produced for
nearby markets and faced high costs when trying to reach distant buyers. The Erie Canal
altered this geography by changing the cost of movement, and in doing so it altered the
pattern of settlement and production.

The canal’s basic innovation was not that water transport existed—rivers and coastal routes
were familiar—but that an engineered corridor could connect two major drainage basins. By
linking the Hudson River to the Great Lakes, the canal created a continuous water route from
the interior to the port of New York. Barges could carry bulky goods at a fraction of the
cost of wagon transport, and because the canal relied on locks to manage elevation changes,
it could traverse terrain that would have defeated a purely river-based route.

The immediate economic effect was a collapse in transport costs. Freight rates fell sharply,
and time to market shortened. That did more than make existing trade cheaper; it changed
what could be traded at all. Farmers could now specialize in crops that were previously too
heavy or too low in value to justify hauling long distances. Lumber, flour, and potash could
move outward, while manufactured goods and imported items could move inward. [A] Towns along
the canal grew as transshipment points, and their growth attracted mills, warehouses, and
services that were themselves dependent on reliable transport.

Yet the canal also reshaped competition. If western grain could reach New York cheaply, it
could also compete with grain from closer farms, pressuring some producers to shift toward
dairy or other products better suited to local conditions. The market did not simply expand;
it reorganized. In regions where land was fertile and transport cheap, prices became more
closely linked to distant markets, and local shortages or surpluses mattered less because
goods could be moved quickly. [B] This integration made some households more prosperous, but
it also exposed them to price swings generated far away.

Migration followed the new corridor. As information and people traveled along the canal,
land values in the interior rose, and settlers moved westward with fewer logistical
barriers. Cities such as Buffalo expanded, and New York City strengthened its position as a
commercial hub. The canal thus contributed to a geographic concentration of finance and
shipping, because merchants and insurers clustered where trade passed through. [C] At the
same time, rival cities sought their own links, and the canal era accelerated a broader
infrastructure race involving railroads and later canals.

The canal’s long-term significance therefore lies in the way it converted physical
engineering into social change. Lower costs encouraged specialization; specialization
encouraged investment in processing; processing encouraged urban growth; and urban growth
fed back into political influence. [D] The corridor that carried wheat and timber also
carried credit, news, and ambition. By the time railroads began to dominate long-distance
freight, the canal had already helped produce a new economic map: one in which inland
production could be tied to ocean trade through a single, engineered path, and in which
distance no longer meant isolation in the same way it once had.

Building the canal also required political imagination. New York State financed a massive
public project at a time when many critics doubted that a government could manage such
scale. Supporters argued that toll revenue and growth would repay the debt, while opponents
feared waste and corruption. The canal’s eventual success helped normalize the idea that
public infrastructure could be an engine of economic development.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: By the time railroads began to dominate long-distance freight, the canal had already helped produce a new economic map: one in which inland production could be tied to ocean trade through a single, engineered path, and in which distance no longer meant isolation in the same way it once had.
   A. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of costs
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to transport and growth
   D. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across costs

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys canal but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed growth first, with transport serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats costs as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   B. The passage presents growth as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once transport is observed, competing explanations for canal collapse. It treats costs as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage explains canal by linking transport to growth, and it shows why costs changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage concedes that transport is often incomplete and concludes that canal cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since costs overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of growth with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, for the phenomenon at issue.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how canal should change if costs is altered, instead of assuming that transport has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to growth must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in costs, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of transport is enough to validate growth for canal, especially regarding canal, especially regarding transport.
   C. The passage implies that costs mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes transport effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of growth no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain canal, as the discussion implies.
   D. The passage treats transport primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over growth are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about canal are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of allometric scaling as a factor influencing transport
   B. discussion of costs as a factor influencing transport
   C. discussion of growth as a factor influencing transport, in the context of the passage.
   D. discussion of canal as a factor influencing transport

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: By the time railroads began to dominate long-distance freight, the canal had already helped produce a new economic map: one in which inland production could be tied to ocean trade through a single, engineered path, and in which distance no longer meant isolation in the same way it once had.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   B. By the time railroads began to dominate long-distance freight. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. By the time railroads began to dominate long-distance freight. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once transport fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and costs can be ignored without changing conclusions about canal.
   B. Because transport directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding canal.
   C. Because the presence of growth guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in costs are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because comparability prevents growth from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold costs constant while examining transport.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | transport | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | costs | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It proves growth is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that canal should be read alongside costs, because transport alone does not settle what growth means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: The Erie Canal altered this geography by changing the cost of movement, and in doing so it altered the pattern of settlement and production.
   A. the idea that Building the canal also required political imagination, in the cases described, as the discussion implies.
   B. the idea that Under such conditions, inland regions often remained economically provincial, as framed by the author.
   C. the idea that They produced for nearby markets and faced high costs when trying to reach distant buyers
   D. the idea that The canal’s basic innovation was not that water transport existed—rivers and coastal routes were familiar—but that an engineered corridor could connect two major drainage...
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses growth, so debate over transport is unnecessary noise, especially regarding costs.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of transport lead to different conclusions about canal.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of transport and growth should be abandoned altogether, especially regarding growth.
   D. to show that the term canal belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
