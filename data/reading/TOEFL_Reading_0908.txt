Passage 0908: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 699)

Under expanded parameter sweeps, researchers have treated poisoning by CO as the decisive
sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. While it is true that in situ
spectroscopy can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn,
forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

the first model can fit one dataset extremely well; still, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how facet dependence
can shift baselines, altering whether poisoning by CO is even comparable across cases,
something that means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation. Provided that
facet dependence is changed while the nominal driver remains constant, one should expect
different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis
on pt is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on facet dependence, many early studies
framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces as a single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] At
first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. Whereas
those studies emphasized poisoning by CO as a signature, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ. [B] The argument hinges on what
would change under an alternative explanation. this shift mattered for how evidence from
laboratory single-crystal studies was generalized because local conditions can change which
processes generate poisoning by CO. [C] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which
prediction follows. [D] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet dependence did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which in situ spectroscopy constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. Even if a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this
sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Only through analysts began combining in situ spectroscopy with cross-site comparisons could
one reasonably claim that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which poisoning by CO could be explained in more than one way largely
because confounders like facet dependence often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a
move that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired with tests
that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat poisoning
by CO as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. In this sense,
metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted
that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which poisoning by CO is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions
rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that rate enhancement is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how support interactions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from automotive catalytic converters. Finally, it maintains that tests combining microkinetic modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   B. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because rate enhancement uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that support interactions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using microkinetic modeling are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats microkinetic modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rate enhancement or support interactions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like support interactions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting microkinetic modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet dependence did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like surface microscopy are needed
   B. unclear
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because adsorbate coverage effects dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail

3. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when support interactions can mimic poisoning by CO.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving in situ spectroscopy.
   C. The author treats laboratory single-crystal studies as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away support interactions, since variability is merely a measurement error.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | temperature-programmed desorption | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | rate enhancement | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | adsorbate coverage effects | Changes the apparent slope |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It makes support interactions irrelevant.
   B. May be muted by other processes
   C. Changes the apparent slope
   D. It replaces temperature-programmed desorption with intuition.

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The discussion suggests that support interactions is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'Pt-active-site chemistry' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   C. The passage implies that industrial hydrogenation reactors is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where microkinetic modeling constrains support interactions

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. Since selectivity shifts is observed in automotive catalytic converters, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. it prevents selectivity shifts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control adsorbate coverage effects
   C. Because adsorbate coverage effects co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once selectivity shifts is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. surface microscopy
   B. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   C. the length of the Nile in miles

   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because poisoning by CO uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates catalyst deactivation.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in laboratory single-crystal studies and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on DFT surface modeling simple.
