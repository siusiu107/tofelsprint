Passage 0093: Antibiotic Stewardship and the Ecology of Resistance (Medicine)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 615)

Antibiotics are often celebrated as miracle drugs, yet their success carries an ecological
price: bacteria evolve. When an antibiotic kills susceptible cells, resistant
variants—whether preexisting or acquired—gain a relative advantage. This is not a moral
failing of microbes; it is population genetics in a hospital gown. The practical question is
how to treat patients effectively while reducing the selection pressure that accelerates
resistance.

Antibiotic stewardship programs emerged to address that tension. Their premise is
straightforward: choose the right drug, at the right dose, for the right duration, and avoid
unnecessary exposure. But the work is more complex than issuing a guideline. Clinicians face
diagnostic uncertainty, especially early in illness, when symptoms overlap. A patient with
fever and a cough could have a viral infection or bacterial pneumonia; waiting for cultures
may take days. [A] In that interval, “just in case” prescribing can feel safer than
restraint, even if the long-term costs are invisible.

Rapid diagnostics can shift this calculus. Polymerase chain reaction tests can identify
pathogens quickly, and biomarkers such as procalcitonin can suggest whether bacterial
infection is likely. Yet tests can mislead if sampling is poor or if colonizing bacteria are
mistaken for causative agents. Moreover, the presence of a pathogen does not always imply
disease; some organisms are carried harmlessly until conditions change. Stewardship
therefore depends on interpretation, not merely technology.

Hospitals also differ in their microbial ecology. In an intensive care unit, invasive
devices and immunocompromised patients create opportunities for opportunistic pathogens, and
broad-spectrum antibiotics can quickly alter community composition. In a community clinic,
respiratory viruses may dominate, and antibiotics may offer little benefit. [B] A policy
that is appropriate in one setting can be counterproductive in another, which is why local
antibiograms—summaries of resistance patterns—matter.

Duration is another leverage point. For years, long antibiotic courses were common, partly
from fear of relapse. Yet evidence in several infections suggests that shorter courses can
be equally effective and reduce collateral damage to the microbiome. The microbiome is not a
decorative concept; it is a functional community that can resist colonization by pathogens.
When antibiotics disrupt it, opportunists such as Clostridioides difficile can flourish,
causing severe diarrhea. Thus, “over-treatment” harms not only by selecting resistance but
also by destabilizing protective ecology. [C]

Stewardship programs often use audits and feedback: pharmacists or infectious-disease
specialists review prescriptions and suggest de-escalation, switching from broad-spectrum to
narrow-spectrum drugs once a pathogen is identified. Success depends on trust. If feedback
is perceived as bureaucratic interference, clinicians may resist; if it is framed as
collegial support, adoption rises. The goal is not to deny treatment but to align immediate
care with evolutionary realism.

Resistance will not disappear, yet stewardship can slow its spread and preserve antibiotic
usefulness. [D] By treating antibiotics as shared resources rather than private consumables,
medicine acknowledges that microbial evolution is shaped by everyday decisions at the
bedside.

A stewardship program can succeed only if its rules are paired with feedback that clinicians
regard as credible rather than punitive.

Hospitals therefore invest in rapid diagnostics not only to treat faster but also to avoid
treating blindly.

Questions
---------
1. [Sentence Insert] In which location would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: When uncertainty is high, clinicians often prescribe broadly, which can intensify selection for resistant bacteria.
   A. [D]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [A]


2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word “de-escalation” is closest in meaning to:
   A. to confuse the reader with unrelated details
   B. switching from broader antibiotics to narrower ones once evidence allows
   C. to store objects in a warehouse
   D. to reverse a decision completely


3. [Factual] According to the passage, which statement is supported?
   A. antibiotic diagnostics plays a central role in the process described, interacting with resistance rather than acting alone. That would make ecology the primary constraint.
   B. antibiotic stewardship plays a central role in the process described, interacting with resistance rather than acting alone.
   C. antibiotic stewardship plays a central role in the process described, interacting with resistance rather than acting alone. That would make narrow-spectrum the primary constraint.
   D. antibiotic stewardship plays a central role in the process described, interacting with resistance rather than acting alone. This would require pathogens to be the limiting factor.


4. [Negative Factual] All of the following are discussed in the passage EXCEPT:
   A. a discussion of lapis lazuli extraction grades in Renaissance contracts.
   B. how resistance modifies or mediates the central phenomenon.
   C. limitations or trade-offs involving broad-spectrum drugs in this discussion.
   D. the role of antibiotic stewardship in shaping outcomes.


5. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary function of the comparison to another interpretation?
   A. to show that explaining antibiotic stewardship requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account. That would make de-escalation the primary constraint.
   B. to show that explaining antibiotic infectious-disease requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account. That would make stewardship the primary constraint.
   C. to show that explaining antibiotic stewardship requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account.
   D. to show that explaining antibiotic stewardship requires weighing evidence and recognizing limits of any single account. That would make medicine the primary constraint.


6. [Inference] Which inference is most strongly supported by the passage?
   A. Changes in pathogens can shift the consequences of antibiotic stewardship, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same. This outcome would hold even if stewardship stays constant.
   B. Changes in resistance must shift the consequences of antibiotic stewardship, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same. This would occur only when stewardship dominates.
   C. Changes in resistance can shift the consequences of antibiotic stewardship, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same.
