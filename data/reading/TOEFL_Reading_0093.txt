Passage 0093: Antibiotic Resistance as Evolution Under Selection and Gene Transfer (Medicine/Biology)
=====================================================================================================
(Word count: 613)

Antibiotics changed medicine by turning once-lethal infections into treatable events, yet
their success contains a built-in vulnerability: every dose applies selection. When bacteria
are exposed to an antibiotic, susceptible cells are killed or inhibited, while rare cells
that carry protective traits survive and multiply. Over time, the population shifts, and the
drug’s effectiveness erodes. Antibiotic resistance is therefore not primarily a moral
failure of individual patients; it is an evolutionary response to a chemical environment
that humans have dramatically reshaped.

Resistance can arise by mutation, such as an altered target protein that the antibiotic no
longer binds efficiently, or by acquiring genes that inactivate the drug, pump it out, or
reduce permeability. One of the most consequential routes is horizontal gene transfer.
Bacteria can exchange plasmids—small circular DNA molecules—through conjugation, passing
resistance genes across strains and even across species. [A] In a hospital ward, where many
species coexist under frequent antibiotic exposure, plasmids act like mobile toolkits,
assembling and distributing resistance faster than mutation alone could manage.

The ecological context matters. In community settings, antibiotic exposure may be
intermittent, and many infections are viral, making antibiotics useless. Nonetheless,
antibiotics are often prescribed “just in case,” especially when diagnostic uncertainty and
patient pressure align. In agriculture, antibiotics have historically been used not only to
treat disease but also to promote growth in livestock, creating additional selection
pressure in animal microbiomes and in surrounding soils and waterways. Resistant bacteria or
resistance genes can then travel through food chains and through waste, linking farms,
communities, and clinics.

Within a single patient, the dynamics can be surprisingly fast. A person may carry a diverse
gut microbiome, including bacteria that are harmless most of the time. When an antibiotic is
taken for a urinary infection, the drug can still sweep through the gut, reducing many
species and leaving ecological space. Resistant strains, even if initially rare, can expand
into that space. [B] What begins as treatment for one site can reorganize microbial
communities elsewhere, turning the body into a temporary selection laboratory.

The consequences appear at multiple scales. For the individual, a resistant infection can
require longer hospital stays, more toxic drugs, or invasive procedures. For health systems,
resistance increases costs and strains intensive-care units, because certain pathogens—such
as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae—are difficult to treat and can spread within
facilities. At the global scale, resistance undermines surgery, chemotherapy, and neonatal
care, all of which rely on reliable infection control.

Responses must match the biology. Stewardship programs aim to reduce unnecessary use by
selecting narrower-spectrum drugs, shortening courses when appropriate, and improving
diagnostics so that viral illnesses are not treated with antibiotics. Infection control—hand
hygiene, isolation, and environmental cleaning—reduces transmission of resistant organisms,
which matters because resistance spreads not only by evolution inside a host but also by
movement between hosts. [C] New drugs and alternative therapies, including bacteriophages,
are explored, yet innovation is slower than the pace at which resistance can spread,
especially when plasmids circulate widely.

Antibiotic resistance, then, is a predictable outcome of repeated exposure. [D] It is driven
by causes that are concrete—selection, gene transfer, and ecological disruption—and it
produces effects that are equally concrete: delayed cures, higher risks, and a narrowing of
medical options. Understanding the chain does not guarantee easy solutions, but it clarifies
why the problem grows whenever antibiotics are treated as inexhaustible.

Where antibiotics are used sparingly and precisely, the evolutionary advantage of resistance
diminishes, though it rarely vanishes.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] The word “intermittent” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. occurring at irregular intervals rather than continuously
   B. fully resistant to antibiotics
   C. carried only by plasmids
   D. designed for hospital intensive-care units

2. [Factual] According to the passage, why are plasmids important in antibiotic resistance?
   A. They can transfer resistance genes between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer
   B. They dissolve antibiotics into harmless sugars
   C. They prevent bacteria from reproducing in any environment
   D. They replace the need for mutation entirely by eliminating DNA

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because plasmids can move between unrelated bacteria, they can spread resistance traits through an entire microbial community.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why resistance can rise quickly within a patient’s gut after antibiotic use?
   A. Antibiotics reduce competing species, creating ecological space that resistant strains can rapidly occupy
   B. Mutation rates drop to zero, preventing susceptible strains from returning
   C. Plasmids are destroyed by antibiotics, leaving only mutants
   D. The gut receives no antibiotic exposure during treatment

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention antibiotic use in agriculture?
   A. To show that selection pressure occurs beyond hospitals and can connect farms, environments, and human infections
   B. To argue that resistance is caused only by patient noncompliance
   C. To claim that livestock cannot carry bacteria
   D. To suggest that agriculture use has no effect on waterways

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as resistance mechanisms EXCEPT:
   A. drug inactivation
   B. efflux pumping
   C. reduced permeability
   D. star-based horizon navigation

7. [Reference] In the passage, “a temporary selection laboratory” refers to:
   A. the way antibiotic treatment can rapidly reshape a patient’s microbiome by favoring resistant strains
   B. a room in which bacteria are cultured for vaccines only
   C. an ocean current that carries microbes between islands
   D. a kiln used to dry fresco plaster

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains resistance as an evolutionary response, describes genetic routes such as plasmids, expands to ecological contexts, then outlines consequences and response strategies
   B. It presents a biography of a single antibiotic discoverer
   C. It lists drug names without discussing causes
   D. It argues that resistance is purely a psychological phenomenon

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the author’s central claim about why resistance is predictable?
   A. Because antibiotics impose selection that favors survival and spread of protective traits, repeated exposure steadily increases resistant populations
   B. Because bacteria do not evolve, resistance appears only by chance miracles
   C. Because stewardship eliminates all need for antibiotics immediately
   D. Because hospitals contain no bacterial diversity

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Resistance is portrayed as an unsolved mystery with no clear causes.
   B. The passage explains antibiotic resistance as an evolutionary consequence of selection pressure, amplified by mechanisms such as plasmid-mediated gene transfer and by ecological contexts including hospitals, communities, and agriculture; it describes how antibiotics can reshape microbiomes within patients, outlines broad medical consequences, and argues that stewardship and infection control must reduce unnecessary exposure and transmission.
   C. The passage claims that resistance can be prevented solely by inventing one new drug every decade.
   D. Antibiotics are described as ineffective because they never kill susceptible bacteria.
