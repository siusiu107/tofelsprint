Passage 0690: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 780)

In classic laboratory tasks, the analysis suggests researchers have treated shifted
confidence judgments as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. Though implicit association tests can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Not the obvious explanation but
methodological humility is what the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance
and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing models would
also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation is granted, then the
same observation—shifted confidence judgments—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat shifted confidence
judgments as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. In
this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label. Only through analysts began combining implicit association tests with
cross-site comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which shifted confidence
judgments could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like self-
concept threat often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors
became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether
two analyses are actually comparable. Rarely has it been the case that the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical, at least before the field adopted
tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat. [A] The author uses the detour to
show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. by comparing cases in
which implicit association tests constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a
disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Even though a single case can be dramatic, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. [C] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as
conditional. [D] The argument hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation.
Working with sparse records and limited controls on self-concept threat, it is difficult to
deny that many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization
as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized shifted confidence
judgments as a signature in one account, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ in another. this shift mattered for how
evidence from workplace decision settings was generalized in part because local conditions
can change which processes generate shifted confidence judgments. In this sense, dissonance
reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. Using implicit association tests under stable conditions, the key question becomes
whether one frequently cited case from workplace decision settings appeared to support the
direct-readout view. the original fit looked visually decisive; still, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in self-concept threat altered the baseline enough to
mute or mimic shifted confidence judgments. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic,
which forces analysts to admit that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted. Using implicit association tests under stable
conditions, the argument reframes the issue so that one frequently cited case from workplace
decision settings appeared to support the direct-readout view. Granted that the original fit
looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in self-
concept threat altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic shifted confidence judgments.
the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, an outcome that illustrates why boundary
conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. In this sense, self-
justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is
often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims
about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize model assumptions?
   A. Since devaluation of rejected alternatives is observed in cross-national survey samples, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. Because self-concept threat co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. it prevents devaluation of rejected alternatives from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control self-concept threat
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once devaluation of rejected alternatives is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on meta-analytic synthesis simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies one mechanism.

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In short, the passage treats methodological humility as a strength, not as an admission of ignorance.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where choice-induced preference paradigms constrains self-concept threat
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'post-choice attitude change' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   C. The passage treats increased liking for chosen options as a confounder and self-concept threat as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The discussion suggests that self-concept threat is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal attitude surveys as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal attitude surveys are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal attitude surveys with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal attitude surveys as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

6. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | longitudinal attitude surveys | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | devaluation of rejected alternatives | Can be degenerate with another effect |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It makes measurement reactivity irrelevant.
   B. It proves increased liking for chosen options is unique.
   C. Can be degenerate with another effect
   D. Requires careful calibration

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conspicuous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:

   A. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   B. easy to notice
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because self-concept threat dominates all evidence
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like behavioral priming designs are needed

8. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that shifted confidence judgments is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic shifted confidence judgments.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving longitudinal attitude surveys.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using longitudinal attitude surveys.
