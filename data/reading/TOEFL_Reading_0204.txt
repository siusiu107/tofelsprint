Passage 0204: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 777)

In replication efforts, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated devaluation of
rejected alternatives as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. While it is true that implicit association tests can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. In replication attempts, one
sees why the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings
unlike workplace decision settings. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the
underlying mechanisms differed largely because measurement reactivity shifted the baseline
in different directions across sites. So the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation, and so, too, does the evidence undermine treating devaluation of rejected
alternatives as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. What matters most is
methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing
models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to explanation be
true, then the same observation—devaluation of rejected alternatives—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
devaluation of rejected alternatives as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats
it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary
conditions to be stated. Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify
measurement reactivity did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which implicit association tests constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. a single case can be
dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. It is the apparent regularity of devaluation of rejected
alternatives that drives the first interpretation: devaluation of rejected alternatives is
treated as a direct readout of mechanism. Should devaluation of rejected alternatives is
uniquely produced by one causal pathway be true, then observations from workplace decision
settings would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. So the
literature is full of such claims, and so, too, does the evidence undermine the caveat that
measurement reactivity might reproduce the same pattern. In this sense, dissonance reduction
after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. What
matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the lesson of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. [A] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of
inference rather than as an embarrassment. Unless one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—devaluation of rejected alternatives—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with
confidence. [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
Whereas popular summaries treat devaluation of rejected alternatives as an endpoint is easy
to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. [C] The author shifts
from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. [D] The author
suggests that the same evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ. Rarely,
unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity, does one
see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which implicit association tests constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, it becomes plausible that the
passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces
competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a
tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories
without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting choice-induced preference paradigms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using choice-induced preference paradigms are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining choice-induced preference paradigms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats choice-induced preference paradigms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.

2. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that shifted confidence judgments is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The author treats consumer choice studies as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when cultural norms about consistency can mimic shifted confidence judgments.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using longitudinal attitude surveys.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   B. choice-induced preference paradigms
   C. increased liking for chosen options
   D. a recipe for bread fermentation

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates public versus private commitment.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on choice-induced preference paradigms simple.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | choice-induced preference paradigms | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | selective memory for supporting evidence | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It proves increased liking for chosen options is unique.
   B. Can mimic the target feature
   C. It replaces implicit association tests with intuition.
   D. Requires careful calibration

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains cultural norms about consistency
   B. The author argues that implicit association tests should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage implies that cross-national survey samples is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The discussion suggests that cultural norms about consistency is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **incremental** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity, does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
   A. gradual
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because cultural norms about consistency dominates all evidence
   C. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like choice-induced preference paradigms are needed

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. public versus private commitment alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. shifted confidence judgments specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. choice-induced preference paradigms as a device rather than as an analytic approach

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   A. Because cultural norms about consistency co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once selective memory for supporting evidence is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. The passage implies that longitudinal attitude surveys directly measures causes, meaning confounding from cultural norms about consistency is impossible.
   D. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency
