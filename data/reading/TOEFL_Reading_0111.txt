Passage 0111: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 730)

When long geodetic records are examined, the analysis suggests researchers have treated
tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust
earthquakes and slow slip. seafloor pressure sensors can make the pattern look unusually
sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike the Chilean margin. the same summary statistic
could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because locked versus creeping
patches shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. the author therefore
separates detection from interpretation, not because treating tsunami-generating seafloor
uplift as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ. In this sense,
megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Never before analysts began combining seafloor pressure sensors with cross-site comparisons
was it defensible to argue that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow
slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the
goal was to break degeneracies in which tsunami-generating seafloor uplift could be
explained in more than one way in part because confounders like locked versus creeping
patches often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became
an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation is granted, then the same observation—tsunami-generating seafloor uplift—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as an endpoint, the passage treats it as
a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. In this sense,
episodic tremor and slip is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify locked versus creeping
patches, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. [A] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the
data cannot rule out. by comparing cases in which seafloor pressure sensors constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, something that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author
treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. a single case can be dramatic; still, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. [C] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead to
a different conclusion. [D] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are
tested.

Not until analysts began combining seafloor pressure sensors with cross-site comparisons did
claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. The passage argues that the
goal was to break degeneracies in which tsunami-generating seafloor uplift could be
explained in more than one way because confounders like locked versus creeping patches often
co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, which changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, slow-slip events on plate interfaces is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the
result is a framework in which tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like seafloor pressure sensors are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because fluid overpressure in faults dominates all evidence
   C. important
   D. irrelevant to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip, serving only as background detail

2. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using seafloor pressure sensors.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when heterogeneous frictional properties can mimic low-frequency tremor bursts.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving seafloor pressure sensors.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away heterogeneous frictional properties, since variability is merely a measurement error.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats numerical rupture simulations as a historical curiosity and does not discuss foreshock clustering or stress transfer after large events. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because foreshock clustering uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that stress transfer after large events is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using numerical rupture simulations are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that foreshock clustering is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how stress transfer after large events can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Cascadia subduction zone. Finally, it maintains that tests combining numerical rupture simulations with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   D. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like stress transfer after large events make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting numerical rupture simulations as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

4. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize model assumptions?
   A. Since low-frequency tremor bursts is observed in Sumatra–Andaman, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. it prevents low-frequency tremor bursts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control locked versus creeping patches
   C. Because locked versus creeping patches co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. Because low-frequency tremor bursts appears, the mechanism must be unique, so locked versus creeping patches can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested.
   A. continuous GPS geodesy as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. foreshock clustering specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. locked versus creeping patches alone, treated as the sole cause

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The discussion suggests that heterogeneous frictional properties is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'strain accumulation and release in subduction zones' refers to a different field altogether, not to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip.
   C. The author argues that continuous GPS geodesy should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where continuous GPS geodesy constrains heterogeneous frictional properties

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the price of coal in 1700
   B. foreshock clustering
   C. inversion of seismic waveforms
   D. Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip

8. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | inversion of seismic waveforms | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | low-frequency tremor bursts | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | locked versus creeping patches | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Can be degenerate with another effect
   B. Requires careful calibration
   C. It replaces continuous GPS geodesy with intuition.
   D. Shifts the baseline

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Cascadia subduction zone and everywhere else.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates heterogeneous frictional properties.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because transient surface deformation uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on numerical rupture simulations simple.
