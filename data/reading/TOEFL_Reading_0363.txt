Passage 0363: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 741)

From a cognitive-control perspective, the analysis suggests researchers have treated
selective memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization. Even if longitudinal attitude surveys can make the pattern
look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike consumer choice
studies. [A] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid
overclaiming. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms
differed because, as the author notes, cultural norms about consistency shifted the baseline
in different directions across sites. [B] The passage highlights that mechanism claims must
survive out-of-sample checks. the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation—not treating selective memory for supporting evidence as a self-sufficient
conclusion. [C] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
[D] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule
out. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which longitudinal attitude surveys constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. To be sure, a single case can be
dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency, does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which longitudinal attitude surveys constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why
the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single case
can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, dissonance reduction after
decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—selective memory for supporting evidence—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with
confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an
endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically revealing.

Seldom, prior to analysts began combining longitudinal attitude surveys with cross-site
comparisons, did investigators concede that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which
selective memory for supporting evidence could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like cultural norms about consistency often co-vary with the driver. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In
this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without
implying that any story is arbitrary. the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive
answer is strong; still, the result is a framework in which selective memory for supporting
evidence is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on choice-induced preference paradigms simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates public versus private commitment.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. choice-induced preference paradigms
   B. the author’s favorite color
   C. shifted confidence judgments
   D. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using choice-induced preference paradigms are unnecessary.
   B. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining choice-induced preference paradigms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats choice-induced preference paradigms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting choice-induced preference paradigms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | longitudinal attitude surveys | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | selective memory for supporting evidence | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | cultural norms about consistency | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It makes measurement reactivity irrelevant.
   B. May not generalize across contexts
   C. It replaces meta-analytic synthesis with intuition.
   D. Shifts the baseline

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal attitude surveys constrains cultural norms about consistency
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'post-choice attitude change' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   C. The author argues that longitudinal attitude surveys should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The passage implies that workplace decision settings is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

6. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **preliminary** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; still, the result is a framework in which selective memory for supporting evidence is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.
   A. early
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because self-concept threat dominates all evidence
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like implicit association tests are needed
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when measurement reactivity can mimic increased liking for chosen options.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using choice-induced preference paradigms.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving choice-induced preference paradigms.
   D. The author treats workplace decision settings as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. behavioral priming designs as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. devaluation of rejected alternatives specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. cultural norms about consistency alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

10. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. Because cultural norms about consistency co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. The passage implies that longitudinal attitude surveys directly measures causes, meaning confounding from cultural norms about consistency is impossible.
   C. it prevents increased liking for chosen options from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency
   D. Since increased liking for chosen options is observed in political opinion panels, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
