Passage 0595: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 711)

In replication efforts, one sees why researchers have treated shifted confidence judgments
as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization. Though
behavioral priming designs can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues
that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for;
this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike consumer choice studies. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely because self-
concept threat shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. the author
therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating shifted confidence
judgments as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ. In this
sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat occurred
when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which behavioral priming designs constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. While it is true that a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat was it
defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which behavioral priming designs constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not until analysts began combining behavioral priming designs with cross-site comparisons
was it clear that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which shifted confidence judgments could be explained in more
than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like self-concept threat often co-
vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. [A] The author treats this as a clue rather
than as a nuisance. If one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same
observation—shifted confidence judgments—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. [B] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. Whereas
popular summaries treat shifted confidence judgments as an endpoint may be convenient, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is
scientifically revealing. [C] The author implies that replication is informative only when
protocols are comparable. [D] The author suggests that the same evidence can support
multiple stories when priors differ. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without
implying that any story is arbitrary. Despite the fact that the temptation to treat a tidy
plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which shifted confidence
judgments is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **plausible** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: by comparing cases in which behavioral priming designs constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like meta-analytic synthesis are needed

   C. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   D. reasonable

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | implicit association tests | Can introduce systematic bias |

   | Confounder | public versus private commitment | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Can introduce systematic bias
   B. Can be degenerate with another effect
   C. It replaces meta-analytic synthesis with intuition.
   D. It makes self-concept threat irrelevant.

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-national survey samples and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on implicit association tests simple.

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: While it is true that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
   A. implicit association tests as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. measurement reactivity alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where meta-analytic synthesis constrains measurement reactivity
   B. The author argues that meta-analytic synthesis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage treats selective memory for supporting evidence as a confounder and measurement reactivity as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The passage implies that political opinion panels is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

   A. behavioral priming designs
   B. a list of Olympic medal counts
   C. selective memory for supporting evidence
   D. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization

7. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize model assumptions?
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if meta-analytic synthesis produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. Because self-concept threat co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. Since selective memory for supporting evidence is observed in workplace decision settings, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control self-concept threat

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using longitudinal attitude surveys.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when measurement reactivity can mimic increased liking for chosen options.
   D. The author treats political opinion panels as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using implicit association tests are unnecessary.
   B. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining implicit association tests with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats implicit association tests as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting implicit association tests as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
