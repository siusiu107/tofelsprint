Passage 0105: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 708)

When catalysts are benchmarked across labs, the central disagreement can be stated more
precisely: researchers have treated poisoning by CO as the decisive sign of heterogeneous
catalysis on platinum surfaces. Despite the fact that DFT surface modeling can make the
pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

The point is not X but the apparent regularity of poisoning by CO; in that framing, drives
the first interpretation: poisoning by CO is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. If
poisoning by CO is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then observations from
industrial hydrogenation reactors would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely
technical. Not the caveat that facet dependence might reproduce the same pattern, but the
literature is full of such claims. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet dependence was it
defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which DFT surface modeling constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of heterogeneous
catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. Should one wishes to move from description to explanation be true, then the same
observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which
it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat poisoning by CO as an endpoint in one account,
the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts in another. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In replication attempts, it becomes plausible that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike industrial hydrogenation reactors. [A] The
author uses the example to separate detection from interpretation. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because facet
dependence shifted the baseline in different directions across sites, which is why
replication matters. [B] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is
narrowed. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating
poisoning by CO as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ. [C] The
discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. [D] The author
implies that replication is informative only when protocols are comparable.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired with tests
that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat poisoning
by CO as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts in another. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic
conversion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted that
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which poisoning by CO is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions
rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **robust** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.
   A. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because catalyst deactivation dominates all evidence
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like in situ spectroscopy are needed
   D. strong and reliable

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | surface microscopy | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | selectivity shifts | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | facet dependence | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It proves rate enhancement is unique.
   B. Adds correlated noise
   C. Depends on modeling priors
   D. It replaces DFT surface modeling with intuition.

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: As a result, the most valuable observations are often taken during transitions, when competing mechanisms diverge most clearly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats surface microscopy as a historical curiosity and does not discuss poisoning by CO or adsorbate coverage effects. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that poisoning by CO is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how adsorbate coverage effects can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from laboratory single-crystal studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining surface microscopy with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   C. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like adsorbate coverage effects make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting surface microscopy as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because poisoning by CO uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that adsorbate coverage effects is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using surface microscopy are unnecessary.

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where microkinetic modeling constrains facet dependence
   B. The passage treats selectivity shifts as a confounder and facet dependence as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'surface-mediated catalysis on Pt' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   D. The discussion suggests that facet dependence is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. in situ spectroscopy as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. poisoning by CO specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. facet dependence alone, treated as the sole cause

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in automotive catalytic converters and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on microkinetic modeling simple.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates support interactions.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selectivity shifts uniquely identifies one mechanism.

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that model assumptions is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents structure-sensitive activity from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control catalyst deactivation
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once structure-sensitive activity is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if in situ spectroscopy produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. Because catalyst deactivation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. a list of Olympic medal counts
   B. poisoning by CO
   C. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   D. surface microscopy

10. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving DFT surface modeling.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away adsorbate coverage effects, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when adsorbate coverage effects can mimic selectivity shifts.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using DFT surface modeling.
