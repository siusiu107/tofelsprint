Passage 0753: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 739)

In classic laboratory tasks, researchers have treated selective memory for supporting
evidence as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
implicit association tests can make the pattern look unusually sharp; still, the passage
argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
something that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives.

Despite the fact that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
measurement reactivity can shift baselines, altering whether selective memory for supporting
evidence is even comparable across cases, something that means that a good fit is not the
same as a good explanation. Unless measurement reactivity is changed while the nominal
driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed
cannot be claimed with confidence. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on measurement reactivity, the argument
reframes the issue so that many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized selective
memory for supporting evidence as a signature is easy to measure, later work asked whether
the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ is harder to interpret
without assumptions. this shift mattered for how evidence from cross-national survey samples
was generalized because, as the author notes, local conditions can change which processes
generate selective memory for supporting evidence.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—selective memory for
supporting evidence—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an
endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity was
it defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. by
comparing cases in which implicit association tests constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author notes that
generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. Even though a single case can
be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. [C] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. [D] This is
why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.

Only through analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-site comparisons
could one reasonably claim that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which selective
memory for supporting evidence could be explained in more than one way because confounders
like measurement reactivity often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is precisely
why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, self-justification
mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Granted that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the
result is a framework in which selective memory for supporting evidence is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. The passage implies that political opinion panels is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where choice-induced preference paradigms constrains self-concept threat
   C. The author argues that choice-induced preference paradigms should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The discussion suggests that self-concept threat is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

2. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if choice-induced preference paradigms produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifted confidence judgments is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. Because cultural norms about consistency co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. increased liking for chosen options specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. choice-induced preference paradigms as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. cultural norms about consistency alone, treated as the sole cause

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-national survey samples and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on meta-analytic synthesis simple.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **sparse** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Working with sparse records and limited controls on measurement reactivity, the argument reframes the issue so that many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like behavioral priming designs are needed
   B. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   C. thinly spread

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats choice-induced preference paradigms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting choice-induced preference paradigms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining choice-induced preference paradigms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using choice-induced preference paradigms are unnecessary.
