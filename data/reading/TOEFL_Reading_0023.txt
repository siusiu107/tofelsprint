Passage 0023: Network Effects, Standards Rivalry, and Coordination in Markets (Economics)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 657)

Some products become more valuable the more people use them. A telephone is the classic
example: a single phone is a paperweight, but a network of phones enables communication.
Digital platforms often share this property, which economists call a network effect. The
effect can be direct, as with messaging systems where each new user expands the set of
people one can reach, or indirect, as with operating systems where more users attract more
software developers, and more software attracts more users. Because value can rise with
adoption, markets with strong network effects can behave differently from markets where each
buyer’s value is independent.

One consequence is the possibility of “tipping.” If two incompatible standards compete—two
video formats, two payment systems—early adoption can snowball. A small lead can become a
large lead if people choose the standard they expect others to choose. Expectations become
causal forces. [A] When buyers fear being stranded with an unpopular format, they may join
the growing standard even if they prefer the rival on technical grounds, because
compatibility becomes more important than isolated performance.

This does not mean that the technically superior standard always loses, or always wins. The
outcome depends on the size of the network effect and on switching costs. If it is easy to
move—if files can be converted or devices can interoperate— then users can chase quality. If
switching is expensive, then people become cautious, and the market can lock into an early
winner. Firms understand this, which is why they subsidize early adoption with discounts or
free services: they are purchasing a user base that will later make the product valuable to
the next wave of users.

Complementary goods amplify the process. A game console with more players attracts more game
studios, which increases the console’s appeal, which brings in more players. The loop is not
mystical; it is a chain of incentives. Developers follow audiences because audiences pay,
and audiences follow catalogs because catalogs entertain. Yet feedback can also stall. If a
platform has many users but its tools for developers are poor, the catalog may remain thin,
weakening adoption. [B] In that case, the platform’s installed base is not enough; the
ecosystem must be cultivated.

Network effects also create strategic dilemmas. A dominant platform may be tempted to
restrict interoperability to protect its lead, but doing so can provoke regulators or can
encourage rivals to form alliances around open standards. Meanwhile, a newcomer can choose
between compatibility and differentiation. Compatibility offers an easier sales pitch—“it
works with what you already have”—but it can also trap the newcomer into competing on thin
margins. Differentiation can attract niche users, yet niches can be too small to trigger a
self-sustaining growth loop.

Importantly, the existence of network effects does not abolish consumer agency; it reshapes
it. A user still makes a choice, but the choice is partly about other users’ choices. The
market becomes social. This social character can make adoption look irrational in hindsight.
A format may win not because it was best, but because coordination was easier on it than on
its rival, perhaps due to a corporate partnership or a timely distribution channel. [C] The
“winner” can then use its installed base to reinforce its position through default settings,
bundled services, and contracts that raise switching costs further.

Nevertheless, network-dominated markets can change abruptly when a new technology alters
interoperability or when user preferences shift toward openness. The rise of web-based
applications, for example, reduced dependence on a single local operating system by moving
software into browsers. Similarly, standards that enable cross-platform messaging can weaken
the power of any one platform by lowering the cost of leaving. [D] The lesson is not that
networks determine destiny, but that they structure the terrain on which competition occurs.
In a market where value is partly made by users themselves, winning is as much about
building coordination as about building features.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "amplify" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Complementary goods amplify the process.
   A. weaken substantially, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. treat as irrelevant, despite references to network and adoption, as the argument develops, especially regarding people.
   C. make larger or more intense, as used to describe how the claim holds across become
   D. close the question permanently, which would rule out further evaluation of become

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys users but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed adoption first, with network serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats become as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, especially regarding platform.
   B. The passage concedes that network is often incomplete and concludes that users cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since become overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of adoption with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage explains users by linking network to adoption, and it shows why become changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage presents adoption as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once network is observed, competing explanations for users collapse. It treats become as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how users should change if become is altered, instead of assuming that network has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to adoption must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage implies that become mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes network effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of adoption no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain users, especially regarding platform.
   C. The passage treats network primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over adoption are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about users are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, especially regarding adoption, under the stated assumptions.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in become, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of network is enough to validate adoption for users.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of sediment provenance as a factor influencing network
   B. discussion of users as a factor influencing network
   C. discussion of become as a factor influencing network, within the passage’s scope.
   D. discussion of adoption as a factor influencing network

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: The effect can be direct, as with messaging systems where each new user expands the set of people one can reach, or indirect, as with operating systems where more users attract more software developers, and more software attracts more users.
   A. The effect can be direct. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   D. The effect can be direct. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because network directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding users.
   B. Because the presence of adoption guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in become are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because once network fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and become can be ignored without changing conclusions about users.
   D. Because comparability prevents adoption from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold become constant while examining network.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | network | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | become | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It proves adoption is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that users should be read alongside become, because network alone does not settle what adoption means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Digital platforms often share this property, which economists call a network effect.
   A. the idea that The effect can be direct, as with messaging systems where each new user expands the set of people one can reach, or indirect, as...
   B. the idea that The market becomes social, in the cases described, in the setting discussed, in the context of the passage.
   C. the idea that A telephone is the classic example: a single phone is a paperweight, but a network of phones enables communication
   D. the idea that Some products become more valuable the more people use them, under the stated assumptions.
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term users belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses adoption, so debate over network is unnecessary noise, in the context of the passage.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of network and adoption should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of network lead to different conclusions about users.
