Passage 0023: Network Effects, Standards Rivalry, and Coordination in Markets (Economics)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 657)

Some products become more valuable the more people use them. A telephone is the classic
example: a single phone is a paperweight, but a network of phones enables communication.
Digital platforms often share this property, which economists call a network effect. The
effect can be direct, as with messaging systems where each new user expands the set of
people one can reach, or indirect, as with operating systems where more users attract more
software developers, and more software attracts more users. Because value can rise with
adoption, markets with strong network effects can behave differently from markets where each
buyer’s value is independent.

One consequence is the possibility of “tipping.” If two incompatible standards compete—two
video formats, two payment systems—early adoption can snowball. A small lead can become a
large lead if people choose the standard they expect others to choose. Expectations become
causal forces. [A] When buyers fear being stranded with an unpopular format, they may join
the growing standard even if they prefer the rival on technical grounds, because
compatibility becomes more important than isolated performance.

This does not mean that the technically superior standard always loses, or always wins. The
outcome depends on the size of the network effect and on switching costs. If it is easy to
move—if files can be converted or devices can interoperate— then users can chase quality. If
switching is expensive, then people become cautious, and the market can lock into an early
winner. Firms understand this, which is why they subsidize early adoption with discounts or
free services: they are purchasing a user base that will later make the product valuable to
the next wave of users.

Complementary goods amplify the process. A game console with more players attracts more game
studios, which increases the console’s appeal, which brings in more players. The loop is not
mystical; it is a chain of incentives. Developers follow audiences because audiences pay,
and audiences follow catalogs because catalogs entertain. Yet feedback can also stall. If a
platform has many users but its tools for developers are poor, the catalog may remain thin,
weakening adoption. [B] In that case, the platform’s installed base is not enough; the
ecosystem must be cultivated.

Network effects also create strategic dilemmas. A dominant platform may be tempted to
restrict interoperability to protect its lead, but doing so can provoke regulators or can
encourage rivals to form alliances around open standards. Meanwhile, a newcomer can choose
between compatibility and differentiation. Compatibility offers an easier sales pitch—“it
works with what you already have”—but it can also trap the newcomer into competing on thin
margins. Differentiation can attract niche users, yet niches can be too small to trigger a
self-sustaining growth loop.

Importantly, the existence of network effects does not abolish consumer agency; it reshapes
it. A user still makes a choice, but the choice is partly about other users’ choices. The
market becomes social. This social character can make adoption look irrational in hindsight.
A format may win not because it was best, but because coordination was easier on it than on
its rival, perhaps due to a corporate partnership or a timely distribution channel. [C] The
“winner” can then use its installed base to reinforce its position through default settings,
bundled services, and contracts that raise switching costs further.

Nevertheless, network-dominated markets can change abruptly when a new technology alters
interoperability or when user preferences shift toward openness. The rise of web-based
applications, for example, reduced dependence on a single local operating system by moving
software into browsers. Similarly, standards that enable cross-platform messaging can weaken
the power of any one platform by lowering the cost of leaving. [D] The lesson is not that
networks determine destiny, but that they structure the terrain on which competition occurs.
In a market where value is partly made by users themselves, winning is as much about
building coordination as about building features.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, what is a direct network effect?
   A. A situation where each additional user increases value by expanding who can only be reached. This outcome would hold even if expectations stays constant.
   B. A situation where each additional user increases value by expanding who can solely be reached. This would occur only when coordination dominates.
   C. A situation where each additional user increases value by expanding who can be reached by tying the effect to audiences.
   D. A situation where each additional user increases value by expanding who can be reached.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “tipping” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a legal ban on platforms
   B. an improvement in technical performance
   C. a rapid move toward one dominant standard
   D. a stable balance where all standards remain equal


3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Once coordination begins, compatibility can outweigh features that matter only to solitary users.
   A. [B]
   B. [A]
   C. [D]
   D. [C]


4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why firms may subsidize early adoption?
   A. They aim to build a user base that increases the product’s value for later users through network effects.
   B. They aim to build a user base that increases the product’s value for earlier users through network effects. This outcome would hold even if effects stays constant.
   C. They aim to build a user base that increases the product’s value for later users through network effects. This would occur only when rivalry dominates.
   D. They aim to build a user base that increases the product’s value for later users through network compatibility. That would make firms the primary constraint.


5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as factors shaping standards competition EXCEPT:
   A. interoperability or conversion ease in this discussion.
   B. complementary goods like software catalogs.
   C. switching costs in this discussion.
   D. the carbon‑14 content of tree rings.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author describe developer tools that are poor despite many users?
   A. To show that an installed base alone may solely not create a thriving ecosystem if complements do not grow. That would make standards the primary constraint.
   B. To show that an installed base alone may not create a thriving ecosystem if complements do not grow by tying the effect to markets.
   C. To show that an installed base alone may not create a thriving ecosystem if complements do not grow.
   D. To show that an installed base alone must not create a thriving ecosystem if complements do not grow. That would make expectations the primary constraint.


7. [Reference] In the passage, “the loop” refers to:
   A. the incentive cycle in which users attract cross-platform and developers attract users. This outcome would hold even if cross-platform stays constant.
   B. the incentive cycle in which users attract developers and developers attract users. This would require standards to be the limiting factor.
   C. the incentive cycle in which users attract developers and developers attract users. This outcome would hold even if developers stays constant.
   D. the incentive cycle in which users attract developers and developers attract users.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It defines network effects, explains tipping and lock-in, then discusses complements, strategic dilemmas, and conditions under which dominance can solely weaken. This would require coordination to be the limiting factor.
   B. It defines network coordination, explains tipping and lock-in, then discusses complements, strategic dilemmas, and conditions under which dominance can weaken. This would occur only when interoperability dominates.
   C. It defines network effects, explains tipping and lock-in, then discusses complements, strategic dilemmas, and conditions under which dominance can weaken.
   D. It defines network effects, explains tipping and lock-in, then discusses complements, strategic dilemmas, and conditions under which dominance must weaken. This would require differentiation to be the limiting factor.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates “the market becomes social”?
   A. A consumer’s payoff depends partly on what other consumers adopt, so expectations shape choices. This outcome would hold even if firms stays constant.
   B. A consumer’s payoff depends partly on what other consumers adopt, so expectations shape choices. This would require developers to be the limiting factor.
   C. A consumer’s payoff depends partly on what other consumers adopt, so compatibility shape choices. This would require interoperability to be the limiting factor.
   D. A consumer’s payoff depends partly on what other consumers adopt, so expectations shape choices.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
