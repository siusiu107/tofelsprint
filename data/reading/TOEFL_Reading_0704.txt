Passage 0704: Network Diffusion of Innovations in Social Media (Sociology)
==========================================================================
(Word count: 773)

Against that intuitive story, researchers have treated homophily versus influence
diagnostics as the decisive sign of network diffusion of innovations in social media. Even
though causal inference with instrumental variables can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives. In replication attempts, it becomes plausible that
the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike
university networks. [A] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as
evidence. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms
differed largely because endogeneity of peer selection shifted the baseline in different
directions across sites. [B] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate
explanations. The issue is not treating homophily versus influence diagnostics as a self-
sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation. [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
[D] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule
out. In this sense, contagion-like spread of new behaviors is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. Only through analysts began combining causal
inference with instrumental variables with cross-site comparisons could one reasonably claim
that claims about network diffusion of innovations in social media stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which homophily versus influence diagnostics could be explained in more than
one way because confounders like endogeneity of peer selection often co-vary with the
driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than
a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the
passage presents as the lesson of network diffusion of innovations in social media:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move
from description to explanation, then the same observation—homophily versus influence
diagnostics—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat homophily versus influence diagnostics as an endpoint is
easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. Only after the field
adopted tests that manipulate or stratify endogeneity of peer selection did the earlier
interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became empirically productive rather
than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which causal inference with instrumental
variables constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design
over isolated exemplars. Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, peer-to-peer adoption cascades in networks is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Rarely, unless the field adopted tests
that manipulate or stratify endogeneity of peer selection, does one see why the debate
became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which
causal inference with instrumental variables constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. To be sure, a single case can be dramatic, yet
the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. Never before analysts began combining causal inference with instrumental
variables with cross-site comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about network
diffusion of innovations in social media stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which homophily
versus influence diagnostics could be explained in more than one way largely because
confounders like endogeneity of peer selection often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a
move that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, innovation
diffusion through social graphs is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label. In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most
informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **coherent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [B] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations.
   A. irrelevant to network diffusion of innovations in social media, serving only as background detail
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like network analysis are needed
   C. well organized
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because status signaling incentives dominates all evidence

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: Never before analysts began combining causal inference with instrumental variables with cross-site comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about network diffusion of innovations in social media stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because homophily versus influence diagnostics uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in online communities and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates status signaling incentives.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on network analysis simple.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Network Diffusion of Innovations in Social Media
   B. causal inference with instrumental variables
   C. the price of coal in 1700
   D. threshold adoption patterns

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats trace-data analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss threshold adoption patterns or platform governance changes. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines network diffusion of innovations in social media and argues that threshold adoption patterns is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how platform governance changes can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace communication graphs. Finally, it maintains that tests combining trace-data analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about contagion-like spread of new behaviors robust.
   C. The passage argues that innovation diffusion through social graphs cannot be studied empirically because confounders like platform governance changes make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting trace-data analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that peer-to-peer adoption cascades in networks is settled because threshold adoption patterns uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that platform governance changes is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using trace-data analysis are unnecessary.

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'peer-to-peer adoption cascades in networks' refers to a different field altogether, not to network diffusion of innovations in social media.
   B. The discussion suggests that endogeneity of peer selection is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The author argues that agent-based modeling should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where agent-based modeling constrains endogeneity of peer selection

6. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving network analysis.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when platform governance changes can mimic cascade size distributions.
   C. The author treats workplace communication graphs as a special case and argues that no broader inference about network diffusion of innovations in social media is possible.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using network analysis.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The passage implies that 'noise' is sometimes a label for unmodeled structure rather than a property of the world itself.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. platform governance changes alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. agent-based modeling as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. threshold adoption patterns specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

9. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | network analysis | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | homophily versus influence diagnostics | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | platform governance changes | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces causal inference with instrumental variables with intuition.
   B. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices
   C. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   D. It makes endogeneity of peer selection irrelevant.

10. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that boundary conditions is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that causal inference with instrumental variables directly measures causes, meaning confounding from platform governance changes is impossible.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if causal inference with instrumental variables produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. Because platform governance changes co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. it prevents homophily versus influence diagnostics from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control platform governance changes
