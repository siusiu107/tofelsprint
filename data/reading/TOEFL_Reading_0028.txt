Passage 0028: Catalytic Converters as Surface Chemistry in Motion (Chemistry)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 611)

A catalytic converter in a car’s exhaust system looks like a passive metal container, yet it
performs a chemically difficult job in a fraction of a second. Exhaust gases contain carbon
monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides, all of which can harm health and
contribute to smog. The converter’s purpose is to transform these molecules into less
harmful products—carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen—without being consumed itself. Its
effectiveness depends on catalysis: the acceleration of chemical reactions by providing an
alternative pathway with lower activation energy.

In a typical converter, precious metals such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium are
dispersed on a ceramic honeycomb. The honeycomb has immense surface area, allowing many gas
molecules to contact catalytic sites as they flow through. When a molecule adsorbs onto a
metal surface, its bonds can weaken or reorient, making it easier for the molecule to react.
Carbon monoxide, for example, can bind to platinum, while oxygen from the exhaust can also
adsorb. On the surface, the two can meet and form carbon dioxide, which then desorbs and
leaves the catalyst ready for another cycle.

Nitrogen oxides pose a different challenge because they contain nitrogen tightly bound to
oxygen. Rhodium is especially effective at reducing these oxides, splitting NO into N and O
on the surface. The nitrogen atoms can pair to form N2, while oxygen can react with carbon
monoxide or hydrocarbons. [A] In other words, the converter coordinates reactions that would
be too slow in free gas collisions by holding reactants in proximity on a surface that
reshapes their bonds.

A converter’s performance depends on temperature. Below a “light‑off” temperature, exhaust
molecules do not adsorb and react quickly enough, so emissions remain high. Once the
catalyst warms, rates rise steeply. This is why short trips can be disproportionately
polluting: the engine may run for only a few minutes, and the converter may not reach its
optimal operating range. Engineers address this by placing converters closer to the engine
or by using strategies that heat the catalyst rapidly after ignition.

Mixture control is also critical. A three‑way converter must both oxidize CO and
hydrocarbons and reduce nitrogen oxides. These reactions demand different oxygen conditions.
If the exhaust is oxygen‑rich, oxidation is easy but reduction of NOx is harder; if the
exhaust is oxygen‑poor, reduction improves but oxidation suffers. Modern engines therefore
use oxygen sensors and feedback control to keep the mixture near a narrow window where both
processes can proceed effectively. [B] The converter’s chemistry is thus inseparable from
engine management; it is part of a coupled system rather than an afterthought.

Catalysts can degrade. Sulfur compounds can “poison” active sites by binding strongly and
blocking them. Thermal stress can cause metal particles to sinter, shrinking surface area as
small particles merge into larger ones. Physical shocks can fracture the ceramic support.
Each failure mode reduces the number of accessible sites, slowing reactions and raising
emissions. The converter’s durability therefore depends not only on the intrinsic catalytic
activity of metals but also on materials engineering that stabilizes dispersion under harsh
conditions.

The converter illustrates a general principle of heterogeneous catalysis: surfaces can
control reaction pathways by controlling encounters. [C] By adsorbing, weakening bonds, and
releasing products, the catalyst turns a chaotic stream of molecules into a sequence of
guided transformations. [D] What seems like a simple box under a car is, at the molecular
scale, a carefully designed landscape where chemistry is compelled to happen faster and
cleaner than it would in open air.

Because the best-performing metals are scarce, researchers also explore alternative
catalysts and supports that preserve activity while reducing cost.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, why does a converter use a ceramic honeycomb coated with metals?
   A. To provide very large surface area so exhaust temperature can contact many catalytic sites. That would make rhodium the primary constraint.
   B. To provide very large surface area so exhaust molecules can contact many catalytic sites.
   C. To provide very large surface area so exhaust molecules can solely contact many catalytic sites. This would require temperature to be the limiting factor.
   D. To provide very large surface area so exhaust molecules must contact many catalytic sites. That would make modern the primary constraint.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “sinter” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. freeze instantly in sense
   B. become electrically charged in sense
   C. dissolve completely into gas

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why short trips can produce higher emissions per minute?
   A. The catalyst must remain below light-off temperature, so reactions proceed too slowly to clean exhaust effectively. This would require different to be the limiting factor.
   B. The catalyst may solely remain below light-off temperature, so reactions proceed too slowly to clean exhaust effectively. This outcome would hold even if oxidation stays constant.
   C. The catalyst may remain sulfur light-off temperature, so reactions proceed too slowly to clean exhaust effectively. This would occur only when rhodium dominates.

   D. thermal sintering of metal particles.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author explain oxygen-rich versus oxygen-poor exhaust?
   A. To show why engine feedback must keep conditions near a narrow window so oxygen-rich and NOx reduction both work. This would require hydrocarbons to be the limiting factor.
   B. To show why engine feedback must solely keep conditions near a narrow window so oxidation and NOx reduction both work. This would occur only when carbon dominates.
