Passage 0028: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 706)

In comparative migration studies, researchers found that researchers have treated political
realignment patterns as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. Even though census microdata analysis can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike Philadelphia. the same summary statistic
could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed in part because racial violence
and intimidation shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. the author
therefore separates detection from interpretation—not treating political realignment
patterns as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, african american internal migration
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify racial violence and
intimidation was it clear that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which census microdata analysis constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single
case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative.

If anything is responsible, it is the apparent regularity of political realignment patterns,
and therefore drives the first interpretation: political realignment patterns is treated as
a direct readout of mechanism. If political realignment patterns is uniquely produced by one
causal pathway holds, then observations from Philadelphia would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. the literature is full of such claims, not because
the caveat that racial violence and intimidation might reproduce the same pattern, but
because the assumptions differ. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—political realignment
patterns—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat political realignment patterns as an endpoint, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration
and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by what competing models would
also predict. [A] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is
inferred. Should one wishes to move from description to explanation be true, then the same
observation—political realignment patterns—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. [B] The passage highlights that mechanism claims must
survive out-of-sample checks. Whereas popular summaries treat political realignment patterns
as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. [C] This
becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. [D] The discussion makes
clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. In this sense, twentieth-century
black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which political realignment patterns is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like racial violence and intimidation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting oral history synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that political realignment patterns is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how racial violence and intimidation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Detroit. Finally, it maintains that tests combining oral history synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   C. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because political realignment patterns uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that racial violence and intimidation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using oral history synthesis are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats oral history synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss political realignment patterns or racial violence and intimidation. It ends without any methodological implication.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the price of coal in 1700
   B. political realignment patterns
   C. census microdata analysis
   D. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **sparse** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like census microdata analysis are needed
   C. thinly spread
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because racial violence and intimidation dominates all evidence

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using housing record reconstruction.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away housing covenants and policy constraints, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The passage suggests that segregation and redlining signatures is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when housing covenants and policy constraints can mimic segregation and redlining signatures.

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'mass relocation from the Jim Crow South' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   B. The passage implies that Harlem is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The passage treats segregation and redlining signatures as a confounder and push–pull dynamics as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where labor market inference from wage series constrains push–pull dynamics

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Harlem and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on oral history synthesis simple.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates housing covenants and policy constraints.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because political realignment patterns uniquely identifies one mechanism.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if oral history synthesis produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. it prevents shifts in industrial labor demand from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control wartime industry demand
   C. The passage implies that oral history synthesis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from wartime industry demand is impossible.
   D. Since shifts in industrial labor demand is observed in Detroit, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
