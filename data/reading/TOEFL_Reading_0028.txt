Passage 0028: Catalytic Converters as Surface Chemistry in Motion (Chemistry)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 611)

A catalytic converter in a car’s exhaust system looks like a passive metal container, yet it
performs a chemically difficult job in a fraction of a second. Exhaust gases contain carbon
monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides, all of which can harm health and
contribute to smog. The converter’s purpose is to transform these molecules into less
harmful products—carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen—without being consumed itself. Its
effectiveness depends on catalysis: the acceleration of chemical reactions by providing an
alternative pathway with lower activation energy.

In a typical converter, precious metals such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium are
dispersed on a ceramic honeycomb. The honeycomb has immense surface area, allowing many gas
molecules to contact catalytic sites as they flow through. When a molecule adsorbs onto a
metal surface, its bonds can weaken or reorient, making it easier for the molecule to react.
Carbon monoxide, for example, can bind to platinum, while oxygen from the exhaust can also
adsorb. On the surface, the two can meet and form carbon dioxide, which then desorbs and
leaves the catalyst ready for another cycle.

Nitrogen oxides pose a different challenge because they contain nitrogen tightly bound to
oxygen. Rhodium is especially effective at reducing these oxides, splitting NO into N and O
on the surface. The nitrogen atoms can pair to form N2, while oxygen can react with carbon
monoxide or hydrocarbons. [A] In other words, the converter coordinates reactions that would
be too slow in free gas collisions by holding reactants in proximity on a surface that
reshapes their bonds.

A converter’s performance depends on temperature. Below a “light‑off” temperature, exhaust
molecules do not adsorb and react quickly enough, so emissions remain high. Once the
catalyst warms, rates rise steeply. This is why short trips can be disproportionately
polluting: the engine may run for only a few minutes, and the converter may not reach its
optimal operating range. Engineers address this by placing converters closer to the engine
or by using strategies that heat the catalyst rapidly after ignition.

Mixture control is also critical. A three‑way converter must both oxidize CO and
hydrocarbons and reduce nitrogen oxides. These reactions demand different oxygen conditions.
If the exhaust is oxygen‑rich, oxidation is easy but reduction of NOx is harder; if the
exhaust is oxygen‑poor, reduction improves but oxidation suffers. Modern engines therefore
use oxygen sensors and feedback control to keep the mixture near a narrow window where both
processes can proceed effectively. [B] The converter’s chemistry is thus inseparable from
engine management; it is part of a coupled system rather than an afterthought.

Catalysts can degrade. Sulfur compounds can “poison” active sites by binding strongly and
blocking them. Thermal stress can cause metal particles to sinter, shrinking surface area as
small particles merge into larger ones. Physical shocks can fracture the ceramic support.
Each failure mode reduces the number of accessible sites, slowing reactions and raising
emissions. The converter’s durability therefore depends not only on the intrinsic catalytic
activity of metals but also on materials engineering that stabilizes dispersion under harsh
conditions.

The converter illustrates a general principle of heterogeneous catalysis: surfaces can
control reaction pathways by controlling encounters. [C] By adsorbing, weakening bonds, and
releasing products, the catalyst turns a chaotic stream of molecules into a sequence of
guided transformations. [D] What seems like a simple box under a car is, at the molecular
scale, a carefully designed landscape where chemistry is compelled to happen faster and
cleaner than it would in open air.

Because the best-performing metals are scarce, researchers also explore alternative
catalysts and supports that preserve activity while reducing cost.


Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, why does a converter use a ceramic honeycomb coated with metals?
   A. To provide very large surface area so exhaust molecules can contact many catalytic sites
   B. To increase exhaust pressure and slow gas flow intentionally
   C. To store fuel for later combustion
   D. To eliminate the need for oxygen sensors

2. [Vocabulary] The word “sinter” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. merge into larger particles, reducing surface area
   B. dissolve completely into gas
   C. freeze instantly
   D. become electrically charged

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Surface contact, rather than chance midair collision, becomes the decisive factor.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why short trips can produce higher emissions per minute?
   A. The catalyst may remain below light-off temperature, so reactions proceed too slowly to clean exhaust effectively
   B. The converter becomes permanently poisoned after a short trip
   C. NOx is not produced at low speed

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as degradation mechanisms EXCEPT:
   A. sulfur poisoning
   B. thermal sintering of metal particles
   C. fracturing of the ceramic support
   D. photosynthetic carbon fixation in leaves

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author explain oxygen-rich versus oxygen-poor exhaust?
   A. To show why engine feedback must keep conditions near a narrow window so oxidation and NOx reduction both work
   B. To argue that oxygen makes all reactions impossible
   C. To claim that three-way converters perform only one reaction
   D. To suggest that mixture control is irrelevant to catalysis

7. [Reference] In the passage, “this failure mode” refers to:
   A. processes that reduce accessible catalytic sites, such as poisoning or sintering
   B. the formation of carbon dioxide on the surface
   C. the production of exhaust gases in the engine
   D. the addition of oxygen sensors to a car

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces catalytic purpose, explains surface reactions for CO and NOx, then discusses temperature and mixture constraints before describing degradation and a broader catalysis principle
   B. It lists metal prices without chemistry
   C. It focuses only on ceramic manufacturing and not reactions
   D. It argues that converters consume precious metals rapidly

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that the converter “coordinates reactions” by holding reactants on a surface?
   A. Adsorption brings molecules together and weakens bonds, enabling faster transformations than free-gas collisions
   B. The converter works by removing molecules with a filter
   C. Reactions accelerate because exhaust is compressed into a smaller volume
   D. Coordination means the catalyst becomes a reactant and is used up

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Catalytic converters reduce emissions mainly by trapping gases permanently inside a container.
   B. The passage explains how catalytic converters use metal surfaces on a high-area support to speed oxidation and reduction reactions, why temperature and oxygen conditions must be controlled for three-way performance, and how poisoning and sintering can degrade activity over time.
   C. Converters work equally well at any temperature because adsorption is irrelevant.
   D. NOx reduction is impossible in exhaust, so converters only oxidize hydrocarbons.
