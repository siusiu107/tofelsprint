Passage 0028: Catalytic Converters as Surface Chemistry in Motion (Chemistry)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 611)

A catalytic converter in a car’s exhaust system looks like a passive metal container, yet it
performs a chemically difficult job in a fraction of a second. Exhaust gases contain carbon
monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides, all of which can harm health and
contribute to smog. The converter’s purpose is to transform these molecules into less
harmful products—carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen—without being consumed itself. Its
effectiveness depends on catalysis: the acceleration of chemical reactions by providing an
alternative pathway with lower activation energy.

In a typical converter, precious metals such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium are
dispersed on a ceramic honeycomb. The honeycomb has immense surface area, allowing many gas
molecules to contact catalytic sites as they flow through. When a molecule adsorbs onto a
metal surface, its bonds can weaken or reorient, making it easier for the molecule to react.
Carbon monoxide, for example, can bind to platinum, while oxygen from the exhaust can also
adsorb. On the surface, the two can meet and form carbon dioxide, which then desorbs and
leaves the catalyst ready for another cycle.

Nitrogen oxides pose a different challenge because they contain nitrogen tightly bound to
oxygen. Rhodium is especially effective at reducing these oxides, splitting NO into N and O
on the surface. The nitrogen atoms can pair to form N2, while oxygen can react with carbon
monoxide or hydrocarbons. [A] In other words, the converter coordinates reactions that would
be too slow in free gas collisions by holding reactants in proximity on a surface that
reshapes their bonds.

A converter’s performance depends on temperature. Below a “light‑off” temperature, exhaust
molecules do not adsorb and react quickly enough, so emissions remain high. Once the
catalyst warms, rates rise steeply. This is why short trips can be disproportionately
polluting: the engine may run for only a few minutes, and the converter may not reach its
optimal operating range. Engineers address this by placing converters closer to the engine
or by using strategies that heat the catalyst rapidly after ignition.

Mixture control is also critical. A three‑way converter must both oxidize CO and
hydrocarbons and reduce nitrogen oxides. These reactions demand different oxygen conditions.
If the exhaust is oxygen‑rich, oxidation is easy but reduction of NOx is harder; if the
exhaust is oxygen‑poor, reduction improves but oxidation suffers. Modern engines therefore
use oxygen sensors and feedback control to keep the mixture near a narrow window where both
processes can proceed effectively. [B] The converter’s chemistry is thus inseparable from
engine management; it is part of a coupled system rather than an afterthought.

Catalysts can degrade. Sulfur compounds can “poison” active sites by binding strongly and
blocking them. Thermal stress can cause metal particles to sinter, shrinking surface area as
small particles merge into larger ones. Physical shocks can fracture the ceramic support.
Each failure mode reduces the number of accessible sites, slowing reactions and raising
emissions. The converter’s durability therefore depends not only on the intrinsic catalytic
activity of metals but also on materials engineering that stabilizes dispersion under harsh
conditions.

The converter illustrates a general principle of heterogeneous catalysis: surfaces can
control reaction pathways by controlling encounters. [C] By adsorbing, weakening bonds, and
releasing products, the catalyst turns a chaotic stream of molecules into a sequence of
guided transformations. [D] What seems like a simple box under a car is, at the molecular
scale, a carefully designed landscape where chemistry is compelled to happen faster and
cleaner than it would in open air.

Because the best-performing metals are scarce, researchers also explore alternative
catalysts and supports that preserve activity while reducing cost.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] What seems like a simple box under a car is, at the molecular scale, a carefully designed landscape where chemistry is compelled to happen faster and cleaner than it would in open air.
   A. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of nitrogen
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across nitrogen
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to oxygen and exhaust

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys converter but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed exhaust first, with oxygen serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats nitrogen as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, especially regarding converter.
   B. The passage concedes that oxygen is often incomplete and concludes that converter cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since nitrogen overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of exhaust with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage explains converter by linking oxygen to exhaust, and it shows why nitrogen changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage presents exhaust as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once oxygen is observed, competing explanations for converter collapse. It treats nitrogen as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that nitrogen mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes oxygen effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of exhaust no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain converter, given the evidence cited, in the cases described, especially regarding exhaust.
   B. A persuasive account would predict how converter should change if nitrogen is altered, instead of assuming that oxygen has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to exhaust must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   C. The passage treats oxygen primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over exhaust are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about converter are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in nitrogen, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of oxygen is enough to validate exhaust for converter.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of exhaust as a factor influencing oxygen
   B. discussion of stress corrosion cracking as a factor influencing oxygen
   C. discussion of nitrogen as a factor influencing oxygen, especially regarding carbon.
   D. discussion of converter as a factor influencing oxygen

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] What seems like a simple box under a car is, at the molecular scale, a carefully designed landscape where chemistry is compelled to happen faster and cleaner than it would in open air.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, for the main claim of the text.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. [D] What seems like a simple box under a car is. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. [D] What seems like a simple box under a car is. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because oxygen directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding converter.
   B. Because once oxygen fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and nitrogen can be ignored without changing conclusions about converter.
   C. Because the presence of exhaust guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in nitrogen are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because comparability prevents exhaust from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold nitrogen constant while examining oxygen.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | oxygen | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | nitrogen | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It proves exhaust is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that converter should be read alongside nitrogen, because oxygen alone does not settle what exhaust means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This is why short trips can be disproportionately polluting: the engine may run for only a few minutes, and the converter may not reach its optimal operating range.
   A. the preceding claim that converter functions as a direct measurement of exhaust
   B. the preceding claim about how oxygen is interpreted in relation to exhaust
   C. the preceding claim that nitrogen alone explains the outcome of converter
   D. the preceding claim that oxygen is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses exhaust, so debate over oxygen is unnecessary noise, especially regarding exhaust, especially regarding exhaust.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of oxygen lead to different conclusions about converter.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of oxygen and exhaust should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to show that the term converter belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
