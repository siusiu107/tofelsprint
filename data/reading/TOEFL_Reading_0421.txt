Passage 0421: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 795)

Despite seemingly clear effect sizes, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated
selective memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization. While it is true that longitudinal attitude surveys can make
the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Using longitudinal attitude
surveys under stable conditions, it is difficult to deny that one frequently cited case from
cross-national survey samples appeared to support the direct-readout view. the original fit
looked visually decisive; still, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in
self-concept threat altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic selective memory for
supporting evidence. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which forces analysts to
admit that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. If anything is responsible, it is methodological
humility, and therefore the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation is granted, then the same
observation—selective memory for supporting evidence—must be paired with tests that change
the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for
supporting evidence as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting
point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret without
assumptions. Working with sparse records and limited controls on self-concept threat, the
argument reframes the issue so that many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized
selective memory for supporting evidence as a signature in one account, later work asked
whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ in another. this
shift mattered for how evidence from cross-national survey samples was generalized because
local conditions can change which processes generate selective memory for supporting
evidence, which is why replication matters. Only after analysts began combining longitudinal
attitude surveys with cross-site comparisons did claims about cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which
selective memory for supporting evidence could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like self-concept threat often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
something that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense,
dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label. Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept
threat occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
by comparing cases in which longitudinal attitude surveys constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to
admit that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even
though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative. Using longitudinal attitude
surveys under stable conditions, the key question becomes whether one frequently cited case
from cross-national survey samples appeared to support the direct-readout view. [A] The
author implies that replication is informative only when protocols are comparable. Although
the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small
shifts in self-concept threat altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic selective memory
for supporting evidence. [B] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can
masquerade as mechanism. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, a move that
illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted.
[C] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred. [D]
The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. In this sense, self-
justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage
concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing
assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool
for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving longitudinal attitude surveys.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic selective memory for supporting evidence.
   C. The passage suggests that selective memory for supporting evidence is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author treats cross-national survey samples as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.

2. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. The passage implies that behavioral priming designs directly measures causes, meaning confounding from public versus private commitment is impossible.
   B. Because selective memory for supporting evidence appears, the mechanism must be unique, so public versus private commitment can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
   D. Because public versus private commitment co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. shifted confidence judgments
   B. implicit association tests
   C. a list of Olympic medal counts
   D. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.
   A. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. choice-induced preference paradigms as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. cultural norms about consistency alone, treated as the sole cause

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing theories?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal attitude surveys constrains self-concept threat
   B. The passage implies that political opinion panels is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'attitude reconfiguration following commitment' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   D. The author argues that longitudinal attitude surveys should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that shifted confidence judgments is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how self-concept threat can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal attitude surveys with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal attitude surveys as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifted confidence judgments or self-concept threat. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like self-concept threat make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal attitude surveys as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that self-concept threat is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal attitude surveys are unnecessary.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on meta-analytic synthesis simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates public versus private commitment.
