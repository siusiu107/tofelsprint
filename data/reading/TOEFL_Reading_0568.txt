Passage 0568: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 654)

When long geodetic records are examined, the central disagreement can be stated more
precisely: researchers have treated tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as the decisive sign
of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip. To be sure, numerical rupture
simulations can make the pattern look unusually sharp, yet the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, an outcome that
forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

If anything is responsible, it is the apparent regularity of tsunami-generating seafloor
uplift, and therefore drives the first interpretation: tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is
treated as a direct readout of mechanism. [A] The author uses the detour to show why a
different metric would lead to a different conclusion. If tsunami-generating seafloor uplift
is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then observations from Sumatra–Andaman would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. [B] The author notes that
generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. the literature is full of such
claims—not the caveat that fluid overpressure in faults might reproduce the same pattern.
[C] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. [D]
The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. In this sense, megathrust
rupture dynamics is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from description to
explanation to fail, then the same observation—tsunami-generating seafloor uplift—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as an endpoint, the passage treats it as
a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move from description
to explanation, then the same observation—tsunami-generating seafloor uplift—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries
treat tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is
scientifically revealing. In this sense, episodic tremor and slip is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify fluid overpressure in
faults, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which numerical rupture simulations constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Granted that a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, slow-slip events on plate
interfaces is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record
can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Though the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. tsunami-generating seafloor uplift specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. paleoseismic trenching as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. locked versus creeping patches alone, treated as the sole cause

2. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats the Japan Trench region as a special case and argues that no broader inference about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip is possible.
   B. The passage suggests that tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using continuous GPS geodesy.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when stress transfer after large events can mimic tsunami-generating seafloor uplift.

   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | continuous GPS geodesy | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | tsunami-generating seafloor uplift | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | heterogeneous frictional properties | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It makes fluid overpressure in faults irrelevant.
   B. Can mimic the target feature
   C. Can be contaminated by background variability
   D. Samples only part of the system

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Sumatra–Andaman and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because tsunami-generating seafloor uplift uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates stress transfer after large events.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on inversion of seismic waveforms simple.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **preliminary** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, episodic tremor and slip is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like seafloor pressure sensors are needed
   B. irrelevant to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip, serving only as background detail
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because locked versus creeping patches dominates all evidence
   D. early

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats inversion of seismic waveforms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss low-frequency tremor bursts or locked versus creeping patches. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that locked versus creeping patches is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using inversion of seismic waveforms are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that low-frequency tremor bursts is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how locked versus creeping patches can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Chilean margin. Finally, it maintains that tests combining inversion of seismic waveforms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   D. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like locked versus creeping patches make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting inversion of seismic waveforms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

7. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize model assumptions?
   A. it prevents low-frequency tremor bursts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control stress transfer after large events
   B. Because low-frequency tremor bursts appears, the mechanism must be unique, so stress transfer after large events can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once low-frequency tremor bursts is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. The passage implies that numerical rupture simulations directly measures causes, meaning confounding from stress transfer after large events is impossible.

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The passage implies that the Cascadia subduction zone is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The discussion suggests that fluid overpressure in faults is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where seafloor pressure sensors constrains fluid overpressure in faults
   D. The passage treats low-frequency tremor bursts as a confounder and fluid overpressure in faults as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. tsunami-generating seafloor uplift
   B. inversion of seismic waveforms
   C. the price of coal in 1700
   D. Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip
