Passage 0735: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 792)

From a cognitive-control perspective, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated devaluation of rejected alternatives as the decisive sign of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization. Though implicit association tests
can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is
conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about
data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. If
anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage presents
as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from
description to explanation to fail, then the same observation—devaluation of rejected
alternatives—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat devaluation of rejected alternatives as an endpoint is easy
to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. In this sense, post-
choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the
apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike
workplace decision settings. [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation
is narrowed. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms
differed because cultural norms about consistency shifted the baseline in different
directions across sites. [B] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. So
the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, and so, too, does the evidence
undermine treating devaluation of rejected alternatives as a self-sufficient conclusion. [C]
The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as an
embarrassment. [D] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows.
Rarely, unless analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-site
comparisons, does one see why claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which devaluation of rejected
alternatives could be explained in more than one way because confounders like cultural norms
about consistency often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, something that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. Only by
analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-site comparisons was the
field forced to accept that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which devaluation of rejected
alternatives could be explained in more than one way because confounders like cultural norms
about consistency often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes
whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, dissonance reduction after
decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Hardly had
the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about consistency
occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which implicit association tests constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic,
the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural
norms about consistency occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which implicit association tests constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is
precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. a
single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, self-justification
mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the
end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is
often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims
about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away self-concept threat, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. The author treats consumer choice studies as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   C. The passage suggests that increased liking for chosen options is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when self-concept threat can mimic increased liking for chosen options.

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. The passage treats increased liking for chosen options as a confounder and self-concept threat as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The passage implies that consumer choice studies is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains self-concept threat
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'attitude reconfiguration following commitment' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   B. meta-analytic synthesis
   C. shifted confidence judgments
   D. the author’s favorite color

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like implicit association tests are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because measurement reactivity dominates all evidence
   C. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   D. unclear

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | meta-analytic synthesis | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | shifted confidence judgments | Can vary across epochs |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Samples only part of the system
   B. Can vary across epochs
   C. It proves selective memory for supporting evidence is unique.
   D. Adds correlated noise

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. self-concept threat alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. devaluation of rejected alternatives specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. choice-induced preference paradigms as a device rather than as an analytic approach

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on longitudinal attitude surveys simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using meta-analytic synthesis are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats meta-analytic synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-national survey samples. Finally, it maintains that tests combining meta-analytic synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting meta-analytic synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

9. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize confounder control?
   A. Because shifted confidence judgments appears, the mechanism must be unique, so public versus private commitment can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifted confidence judgments is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. The passage implies that meta-analytic synthesis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from public versus private commitment is impossible.
