Passage 0145: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 736)

In policy discussions, the analysis suggests researchers have treated disparate exposure to
pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Even though longitudinal panel data can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were
applied in settings unlike post-industrial cities. The passage argues that the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because zoning rules
and land-use regulation shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. The issue
is not treating disparate exposure to pollution as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that
the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense, spatial
stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The author suggests that the
same evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation holds, then the same observation—disparate exposure to
pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B]
The author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. Whereas
popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint in one account, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in
another. [C] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as
conditional. [D] The author uses the example to separate detection from interpretation.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify zoning rules and land-use
regulation did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which longitudinal panel data constrains alternatives, researchers could
ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one
wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—disparate exposure
to pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint looks
decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication.

If anything is responsible, it is the apparent regularity of disparate exposure to
pollution, and therefore drives the first interpretation: disparate exposure to pollution is
treated as a direct readout of mechanism. If disparate exposure to pollution is uniquely
produced by one causal pathway, a different prediction follows: then observations from post-
industrial cities would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. The
issue is not the caveat that zoning rules and land-use regulation might reproduce the same
pattern; it is that the literature is full of such claims. In this sense, persistent
neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about residential
segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Although the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong,
the result is a framework in which disparate exposure to pollution is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices
   B. May not generalize across contexts
   C. It replaces audit studies in housing markets with intuition.
   D. Shifts the baseline

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. wealth accumulation gaps
   B. spatial autocorrelation analysis
   C. a recipe for bread fermentation
   D. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in large U.S. metropolitan areas and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on quasi-experimental policy evaluation simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates credit market discrimination.

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The passage implies that rapidly growing Sun Belt regions is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'spatial stratification in cities' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where quasi-experimental policy evaluation constrains path dependence from historical redlining
   D. The author argues that quasi-experimental policy evaluation should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how path dependence from historical redlining can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from European migrant neighborhoods. Finally, it maintains that tests combining audit studies in housing markets with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   B. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting audit studies in housing markets as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that path dependence from historical redlining is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using audit studies in housing markets are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats audit studies in housing markets as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or path dependence from historical redlining. It ends without any methodological implication.

6. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away zoning rules and land-use regulation, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when zoning rules and land-use regulation can mimic mobility constraints across space.
   C. The author treats post-industrial cities as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   D. The passage suggests that mobility constraints across space is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **subtle** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Whereas popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like quasi-experimental policy evaluation are needed
   B. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because credit market discrimination dominates all evidence
   D. slight

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. Because school-quality gradients appears, the mechanism must be unique, so informational asymmetries in housing search can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. The passage implies that audit studies in housing markets directly measures causes, meaning confounding from informational asymmetries in housing search is impossible.
   C. it prevents school-quality gradients from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control informational asymmetries in housing search
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once school-quality gradients is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: The issue is not treating disparate exposure to pollution as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation.
   A. wealth accumulation gaps specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. credit market discrimination alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. quasi-experimental policy evaluation as a device rather than as an analytic approach
