Passage 0004: Maize Domestication as Gradual Selection Across Landscapes (Anthropology)
=======================================================================================
(Word count: 608)

Maize is so central to the modern diet that it can be easy to forget how improbable it once
seemed. Its wild relative, teosinte, bears small, hard kernels sealed in a tough casing—an
efficient design for a wild grass, but an awkward one for human consumption. The
transformation from teosinte to maize did not happen by accident, nor did it happen all at
once. It unfolded as a series of choices, made by growers over generations, that altered the
plant’s architecture, kernel accessibility, and yield.

For a long time, scholars assumed that domestication must have been swift, because maize
looks so different from teosinte. Under that assumption, a single dramatic genetic change
was expected to have produced a “domesticated” form, after which farmers merely spread the
crop. That story began to weaken when archaeologists recovered early cobs from sites in
Mesoamerica and found that they were neither teosinte nor modern maize but something in
between: small, with partial kernel exposure and variable row patterns. The intermediate
forms implied a gradual transition in which people cultivated plants that were improved but
not yet fully transformed.

A second revision came from the geography of finds. Early maize remains cluster not in a
single oasis but across multiple valleys, often in contexts that suggest mixed
subsistence—small-scale cultivation combined with foraging. Rather than imagining
domestication as a single invention, researchers began to see it as an ongoing relationship
between people and plant, shaped by local environments and cultural preferences. [A] In
wetter lowlands, selection could favor plants that tolerated dense planting, whereas in
drier uplands, growers might favor plants that matured quickly before seasonal rains ended.
[B] Over centuries, such choices could steer populations in different directions before
trade and migration blended them. [C]

The causal logic of domestication becomes clearer when one considers what growers actually
do. They keep seeds from plants that performed well under the conditions they care about. If
kernels are easier to grind, if cobs hold more seeds, or if plants stand upright when winds
are strong, those traits become criteria for saving seed. Because the same family often
reuses seed from a small subset of plants, selection can be intense even without formal
breeding. At the same time, gene flow from wild teosinte can reintroduce tough casings and
shattering, so domestication can be a tug between cultivation and wild exchange rather than
a one-way march.

By the time maize spread beyond its homeland, it carried evidence of that tug. Some lineages
show traits consistent with highland adaptation—such as sensitivity to day length—while
others align with lowland conditions. The crop’s later success in North America was not
simply a matter of transport; it required further adjustments to climates with different
growing seasons. [D] Thus, the maize that appears in later archaeological layers is best
seen not as a finished invention but as a plant still being negotiated, genetically and
culturally, with each new environment.

The domestication of maize therefore looks less like a single breakthrough and more like a
long conversation. Each generation of growers, by choosing what to plant again, turned
preferences and constraints into evolutionary pressure. The result was a crop whose modern
form masks a history of intermediate stages, local pathways, and continued change.

A few traits were especially consequential. Selection for “non‑shattering” ears, which hold
kernels rather than dispersing them, made harvest predictable; selection for thinner casings
made processing faster. Storage also mattered: kernels that dried reliably without molding
could be saved, traded, and replanted, so the ability to mature and dry within a season
became a trait with cultural value as well as biological utility.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, what evidence challenged the idea that maize domestication was swift?
   A. Discovery of early cobs with intermediate features between teosinte and modern maize.
   B. Discovery of early cobs with intermediate features between teosinte and modern maize. This would occur only when intermediate dominates.
   C. Discovery of early cobs with intermediate features between teosinte and modern maize. That would make domestication the primary constraint.
   D. Discovery of early cobs with intermediate features between teosinte and modern landscapes. That would make intermediate the primary constraint.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “cluster” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. disappear suddenly in sense
   B. scatter randomly in sense
   C. harden permanently in sense
   D. gather together in a group


3. [Inference] What can be inferred about why domestication could proceed without formal breeding programs?
   A. Saving seed from a small subset of successful plants must create strong selection across generations. This outcome would hold even if different stays constant.
   B. Saving seed from a small subset of successful plants can create strong selection across generations.
   C. Saving seed from a small subset of successful plants can solely create strong selection across generations. This would require intermediate to be the limiting factor.
   D. Saving seed from a small subset of successful plants can create strong conditions across generations. This would occur only when rather dominates.


4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because climates differ sharply over short distances, the “best” plant can vary from valley to valley.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [D]
   D. [C]


5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as ways environments could shape selection EXCEPT:
   A. upright stalks under strong winds.
   B. tolerance of dense planting in wetter lowlands.
   C. quick maturation in drier uplands.
   D. survival in vacuum conditions without water.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention gene flow from wild teosinte?
   A. To show that domestication could be slowed or complicated by wild traits re-entering cultivated populations.
   B. To show that domestication could be slowed or complicated by wild traits re-entering cultivated populations. That would make rather the primary constraint.
   C. To show that domestication could be slowed or complicated by wild traits re-entering cultivated populations. This outcome would hold even if preferences stays constant.
   D. To show that north could be slowed or complicated by wild traits re-entering cultivated populations. This would require invention to be the limiting factor.


7. [Reference] In the phrase “that tug,” the word “tug” refers to:
   A. the conflict between cultivation-driven selection and reintroduction of wild traits. This would require storage to be the limiting factor.
   B. the conflict between cultivation-driven selection and reintroduction of wild traits. This would require one-way to be the limiting factor.
   C. the conflict between cultivation-driven domestication and reintroduction of wild traits. This outcome would hold even if mesoamerica stays constant.
   D. the conflict between cultivation-driven selection and reintroduction of wild traits.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It begins with an old assumption, introduces new archaeological and geographic evidence, and then explains domestication as repeated selection shaped by environments. This would occur only when intermediate dominates.
   B. It begins with an old assumption, introduces new archaeological and geographic evidence, and then explains domestication as repeated selection shaped by environments.
   C. It begins with an old assumption, introduces new archaeological and geographic evidence, and then explains domestication as repeated selection shaped by environments. This would require different to be the limiting factor.
   D. It begins with an old assumption, introduces new archaeological and geographic evidence, and then explains conditions as repeated selection shaped by environments. This outcome would hold even if maize stays constant.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that domestication was “a long conversation”?
   A. Repeated planting choices across generations gradually turned human conditions into evolutionary pressure on the crop. That would make anthropology the primary constraint.
   B. Repeated planting choices across generations gradually turned human preferences into evolutionary pressure on the crop.
   C. Repeated planting choices across generations gradually turned human preferences into evolutionary pressure on the crop. This would require mesoamerica to be the limiting factor.
   D. Repeated planting choices across generations gradually turned human preferences into evolutionary pressure on the crop. That would make conditions the primary constraint.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage argues that one-way domestication proceeded through intermediate stages and multiple local pathways, as growers repeatedly saved seed from desirable plants while wild gene flow and varied environments shaped the crop’s gradual transformation. This would occur only when selection dominates.
   B. The passage argues that maize domestication proceeded through intermediate stages and multiple local pathways, as growers repeatedly saved seed from desirable plants while wild gene flow and varied environments shaped the crop’s gradual transformation. This would require cultivation to be the limiting factor.
