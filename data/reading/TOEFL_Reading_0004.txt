Passage 0004: Maize Domestication as Gradual Selection Across Landscapes (Anthropology)
=======================================================================================
(Word count: 608)

Maize is so central to the modern diet that it can be easy to forget how improbable it once
seemed. Its wild relative, teosinte, bears small, hard kernels sealed in a tough casing—an
efficient design for a wild grass, but an awkward one for human consumption. The
transformation from teosinte to maize did not happen by accident, nor did it happen all at
once. It unfolded as a series of choices, made by growers over generations, that altered the
plant’s architecture, kernel accessibility, and yield.

For a long time, scholars assumed that domestication must have been swift, because maize
looks so different from teosinte. Under that assumption, a single dramatic genetic change
was expected to have produced a “domesticated” form, after which farmers merely spread the
crop. That story began to weaken when archaeologists recovered early cobs from sites in
Mesoamerica and found that they were neither teosinte nor modern maize but something in
between: small, with partial kernel exposure and variable row patterns. The intermediate
forms implied a gradual transition in which people cultivated plants that were improved but
not yet fully transformed.

A second revision came from the geography of finds. Early maize remains cluster not in a
single oasis but across multiple valleys, often in contexts that suggest mixed
subsistence—small-scale cultivation combined with foraging. Rather than imagining
domestication as a single invention, researchers began to see it as an ongoing relationship
between people and plant, shaped by local environments and cultural preferences. [A] In
wetter lowlands, selection could favor plants that tolerated dense planting, whereas in
drier uplands, growers might favor plants that matured quickly before seasonal rains ended.
[B] Over centuries, such choices could steer populations in different directions before
trade and migration blended them. [C]

The causal logic of domestication becomes clearer when one considers what growers actually
do. They keep seeds from plants that performed well under the conditions they care about. If
kernels are easier to grind, if cobs hold more seeds, or if plants stand upright when winds
are strong, those traits become criteria for saving seed. Because the same family often
reuses seed from a small subset of plants, selection can be intense even without formal
breeding. At the same time, gene flow from wild teosinte can reintroduce tough casings and
shattering, so domestication can be a tug between cultivation and wild exchange rather than
a one-way march.

By the time maize spread beyond its homeland, it carried evidence of that tug. Some lineages
show traits consistent with highland adaptation—such as sensitivity to day length—while
others align with lowland conditions. The crop’s later success in North America was not
simply a matter of transport; it required further adjustments to climates with different
growing seasons. [D] Thus, the maize that appears in later archaeological layers is best
seen not as a finished invention but as a plant still being negotiated, genetically and
culturally, with each new environment.

The domestication of maize therefore looks less like a single breakthrough and more like a
long conversation. Each generation of growers, by choosing what to plant again, turned
preferences and constraints into evolutionary pressure. The result was a crop whose modern
form masks a history of intermediate stages, local pathways, and continued change.

A few traits were especially consequential. Selection for “non‑shattering” ears, which hold
kernels rather than dispersing them, made harvest predictable; selection for thinner casings
made processing faster. Storage also mattered: kernels that dried reliably without molding
could be saved, traded, and replanted, so the ability to mature and dry within a season
became a trait with cultural value as well as biological utility.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: That story began to weaken when archaeologists recovered early cobs from sites in Mesoamerica and found that they were neither teosinte nor modern maize but something in between: small, with partial kernel exposure and variable row patterns.
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across domestication
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of domestication
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to plants and teosinte

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that plants is often incomplete and concludes that maize cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since domestication overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of teosinte with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage surveys maize but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed teosinte first, with plants serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats domestication as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   C. The passage presents teosinte as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once plants is observed, competing explanations for maize collapse. It treats domestication as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding growers.
   D. The passage explains maize by linking plants to teosinte, and it shows why domestication changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in domestication, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of plants is enough to validate teosinte for maize.
   B. The passage implies that domestication mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes plants effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of teosinte no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain maize, especially regarding growers.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how maize should change if domestication is altered, instead of assuming that plants has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to teosinte must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage treats plants primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over teosinte are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about maize are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, especially regarding plants, especially regarding plants.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of domestication as a factor influencing plants, as the argument develops.
   B. discussion of maize as a factor influencing plants
   C. discussion of teosinte as a factor influencing plants
   D. discussion of thermal hysteresis as a factor influencing plants

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: That story began to weaken when archaeologists recovered early cobs from sites in Mesoamerica and found that they were neither teosinte nor modern maize but something in between: small, with partial kernel exposure and variable row patterns.
   A. That story began to weaken when archaeologists recovered early cobs from sites in Mesoamerica and found that they were neither teosinte nor modern maize but something in between: small.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding plants, especially regarding growers, especially regarding kernels, especially regarding maize.
   C. That story began to weaken when archaeologists recovered early cobs from sites in Mesoamerica and found that they were neither teosinte nor modern maize but something in between: small.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, as framed by the author, especially regarding teosinte.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of teosinte guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in domestication are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because plants directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding maize.
   C. Because once plants fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and domestication can be ignored without changing conclusions about maize.
   D. Because comparability prevents teosinte from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold domestication constant while examining plants.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | plants | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | domestication | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It proves teosinte is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that maize should be read alongside domestication, because plants alone does not settle what teosinte means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "it" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: The transformation from teosinte to maize did not happen by accident, nor did it happen all at once.
   A. the idea that It unfolded as a series of choices, made by growers over generations, that altered the plant’s architecture, kernel accessibility, and yield, in the cases described.
   B. the idea that Its wild relative, teosinte, bears small, hard kernels sealed in a tough casing—an efficient design for a wild grass, but an awkward one for...
   C. the idea that A few traits were especially consequential, in the setting discussed, in the setting discussed, given the evidence cited.
   D. the idea that Maize is so central to the modern diet that it can be easy to forget how improbable it once seemed
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses teosinte, so debate over plants is unnecessary noise, as the discussion implies.
   B. to show that the term maize belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding maize.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of plants and teosinte should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of plants lead to different conclusions about maize.
