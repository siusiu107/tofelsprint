Passage 0052: CAM Photosynthesis and How Desert Plants Re-Schedule Carbon Intake (Botany)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 600)

In a temperate garden, a leaf usually opens its stomata during the day, admitting carbon
dioxide while sunlight powers photosynthesis. In many deserts, that daytime strategy can be
lethal. Dry air and intense heat pull water from open stomata so aggressively that a plant
can lose more water than it can replace. Yet desert plants still must acquire carbon to
grow. One solution, evolved independently in multiple lineages, is crassulacean acid
metabolism, or CAM.

CAM reorganizes the timing of gas exchange. At night, when temperatures fall and humidity
rises, CAM plants open their stomata and take in carbon dioxide. Instead of feeding that
carbon immediately into the Calvin cycle, they convert it to organic acids—often malic
acid—and store those acids in vacuoles within their cells. During the day, stomata close,
sharply reducing water loss, while the stored acids are broken down to release carbon
dioxide internally. Photosynthesis proceeds behind closed doors, powered by sunlight but
supplied by nighttime carbon capture. [A] The plant, in effect, shifts the most water-
expensive step to the least water-expensive hours.

The mechanism has costs. Because vacuole capacity is finite, a CAM plant can store only so
much acid overnight, which places a ceiling on how much carbon it can fix the next day.
Consequently, CAM plants often grow more slowly than plants using the more common C3
pathway. Moreover, CAM leaves and stems are frequently thick and succulent, both to store
water and to provide room for acid storage, a morphology that can limit heat dissipation and
can constrain shape. The payoff is survival under chronic drought, not maximum speed in
benign conditions.

CAM also exists on a spectrum. Some species are “obligate” CAM, using the pathway regardless
of conditions. Others are “facultative,” switching from C3-like behavior to CAM-like
behavior during drought. A cactus may remain strongly CAM even after rains, whereas a semi-
succulent shrub may behave almost like a daytime breather when water is plentiful and then
tighten its schedule as soils dry. [B] This flexibility suggests that CAM is not merely a
trait but a regulatory program, one that responds to signals such as water potential,
temperature, and day length.

Ecologically, CAM reshapes interactions. By closing stomata during the day, CAM plants
reduce transpiration cooling, so leaf temperatures can rise; this can influence which
insects feed on them and which pathogens can persist. CAM plants can also alter soil
moisture patterns. Because they take up carbon at night, they may demand less daytime water
transport, allowing water storage tissues to buffer midday stress without drawing as much
from the soil. In dense communities, such differences can affect competition: CAM plants may
endure droughts that suppress C3 neighbors, enabling them to dominate rocky slopes or
epiphytic niches on tree branches where water arrives as brief pulses.

Researchers interested in agriculture have studied CAM because it offers a conceptual
blueprint for water-efficient crops. Transferring CAM into major grains is not
straightforward, because the pathway depends on anatomical traits, transporters, and diurnal
gene regulation. Yet partial CAM-like strategies—tightening stomatal timing, increasing
nocturnal carbon capture, or enhancing vacuole storage—could improve water use in arid
regions. The excitement is not that CAM is “better” photosynthesis, but that it demonstrates
an alternative schedule for balancing carbon gain and water loss.

In short, CAM is photosynthesis with a clock. [C] It separates intake from processing, using
night to gather carbon and day to spend it. [D] In landscapes where the sun is abundant but
water is scarce, that temporal rearrangement can keep a plant alive long enough to turn thin
rainfall into persistent tissue.

   A. at night, when temperatures are lower and humidity is higher
   B. at noon, when sunlight is strongest
   C. only during winter storms
   D. never; they absorb carbon through roots

   A. required and consistently expressed regardless of conditions
   B. accidental and temporary
   C. harmful and avoided
   D. related to insect feeding

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: By decoupling uptake from use, CAM changes when the plant pays the water cost of breathing.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why CAM plants often grow more slowly than C3 plants?
   A. Limited overnight acid storage constrains daily carbon fixation, reducing potential growth rate
   B. They receive less sunlight in deserts
   C. They cannot photosynthesize during the day at all
   D. Their stomata remain open continuously and waste water

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as features or consequences of CAM EXCEPT:
   A. nighttime carbon capture and daytime acid breakdown
   B. stomatal closure during the day reducing water loss
   C. a maximum carbon storage limit set by vacuole capacity
   D. formation of Einstein rings around leaf cells

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author describe CAM as “photosynthesis with a clock”?
   A. Because the pathway depends on shifting steps to different times of day to balance water and carbon
   B. Because CAM plants measure time with visible mechanical clocks
   C. Because sunlight is unnecessary for CAM photosynthesis
   D. Because CAM always occurs only at dawn

7. [Reference] In the passage, “those acids” refers to:
   A. organic acids such as malic acid stored overnight in vacuoles
   B. soil acids that dissolve rocks
   C. industrial acids sprayed on crops
   D. acids produced by insects feeding on leaves

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces the desert water problem, explains CAM timing and chemistry, discusses costs and variation, then explores ecological consequences and agricultural interest
   B. It lists cactus species alphabetically
   C. It compares only C4 and CAM without mechanisms
   D. It focuses exclusively on plant pathogens and ignores photosynthesis

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that CAM is a “regulatory program”?
   A. Some plants adjust the degree of CAM-like behavior in response to drought-related signals and environmental cues
   B. CAM is a single gene that never changes expression
   C. Regulation means CAM plants are immune to heat
   D. Programs refer only to computer software in laboratories

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. CAM is a photosynthetic pathway that increases growth speed by keeping stomata open during the hottest hours.
   B.

   C. Desert plants survive mainly by avoiding photosynthesis entirely.
   D. Vacuoles function only to store sunlight for later use.
