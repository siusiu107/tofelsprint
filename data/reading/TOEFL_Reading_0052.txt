Passage 0052: CAM Photosynthesis and How Desert Plants Re-Schedule Carbon Intake (Botany)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 600)

In a temperate garden, a leaf usually opens its stomata during the day, admitting carbon
dioxide while sunlight powers photosynthesis. In many deserts, that daytime strategy can be
lethal. Dry air and intense heat pull water from open stomata so aggressively that a plant
can lose more water than it can replace. Yet desert plants still must acquire carbon to
grow. One solution, evolved independently in multiple lineages, is crassulacean acid
metabolism, or CAM.

CAM reorganizes the timing of gas exchange. At night, when temperatures fall and humidity
rises, CAM plants open their stomata and take in carbon dioxide. Instead of feeding that
carbon immediately into the Calvin cycle, they convert it to organic acids—often malic
acid—and store those acids in vacuoles within their cells. During the day, stomata close,
sharply reducing water loss, while the stored acids are broken down to release carbon
dioxide internally. Photosynthesis proceeds behind closed doors, powered by sunlight but
supplied by nighttime carbon capture. [A] The plant, in effect, shifts the most water-
expensive step to the least water-expensive hours.

The mechanism has costs. Because vacuole capacity is finite, a CAM plant can store only so
much acid overnight, which places a ceiling on how much carbon it can fix the next day.
Consequently, CAM plants often grow more slowly than plants using the more common C3
pathway. Moreover, CAM leaves and stems are frequently thick and succulent, both to store
water and to provide room for acid storage, a morphology that can limit heat dissipation and
can constrain shape. The payoff is survival under chronic drought, not maximum speed in
benign conditions.

CAM also exists on a spectrum. Some species are “obligate” CAM, using the pathway regardless
of conditions. Others are “facultative,” switching from C3-like behavior to CAM-like
behavior during drought. A cactus may remain strongly CAM even after rains, whereas a semi-
succulent shrub may behave almost like a daytime breather when water is plentiful and then
tighten its schedule as soils dry. [B] This flexibility suggests that CAM is not merely a
trait but a regulatory program, one that responds to signals such as water potential,
temperature, and day length.

Ecologically, CAM reshapes interactions. By closing stomata during the day, CAM plants
reduce transpiration cooling, so leaf temperatures can rise; this can influence which
insects feed on them and which pathogens can persist. CAM plants can also alter soil
moisture patterns. Because they take up carbon at night, they may demand less daytime water
transport, allowing water storage tissues to buffer midday stress without drawing as much
from the soil. In dense communities, such differences can affect competition: CAM plants may
endure droughts that suppress C3 neighbors, enabling them to dominate rocky slopes or
epiphytic niches on tree branches where water arrives as brief pulses.

Researchers interested in agriculture have studied CAM because it offers a conceptual
blueprint for water-efficient crops. Transferring CAM into major grains is not
straightforward, because the pathway depends on anatomical traits, transporters, and diurnal
gene regulation. Yet partial CAM-like strategies—tightening stomatal timing, increasing
nocturnal carbon capture, or enhancing vacuole storage—could improve water use in arid
regions. The excitement is not that CAM is “better” photosynthesis, but that it demonstrates
an alternative schedule for balancing carbon gain and water loss.

In short, CAM is photosynthesis with a clock. [C] It separates intake from processing, using
night to gather carbon and day to spend it. [D] In landscapes where the sun is abundant but
water is scarce, that temporal rearrangement can keep a plant alive long enough to turn thin
rainfall into persistent tissue.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, when do CAM plants typically open their stomata to take in carbon dioxide?
   A. at night, when temperatures are solely lower and humidity is higher. This would require calvin to be the limiting factor.
   B. at night, when temperatures are lower and humidity is lower. This would require conditions to be the limiting factor.
   C. at night, when temperatures are lower and humidity is higher.
   D. at night, when calvin are lower and humidity is higher. This would occur only when photosynthesis dominates.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “obligate” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. accidental and temporary in sense
   B. required and consistently expressed regardless of conditions

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why CAM plants often grow more slowly than C3 plants?
   A. Limited overnight acid storage constrains daily carbon fixation, reducing potential growth rate. This outcome would hold even if temperatures stays constant.
   B. Limited overnight acid storage constrains daily carbon fixation, reducing potential growth rate. This outcome would hold even if researchers stays constant.

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author describe CAM as “photosynthesis with a clock”?

   B. even though the pathway depends on shifting steps to different times of day to balance water and carbon. This would occur only when carbon dominates.
   C. Because the pathway depends on shifting steps to different times of day to balance water and carbon.
