Passage 0018: Public-Key Cryptography, RSA, and the Architecture of Trust (Computer Science)
============================================================================================
(Word count: 639)

Sending a secret over an open network seems impossible at first: if an eavesdropper can copy
every packet, how can two people exchange a key without already sharing one? For centuries,
the practical answer was to rely on couriers or on prearranged codes. Public‑key
cryptography changed that answer by splitting a single role—“the key”—into two roles that
interlock: a public component that can be shared widely and a private component that must
remain hidden. The public part does not reveal the private part easily, yet the two together
allow a message to be locked by anyone and unlocked by only one holder.

RSA, one of the most influential public‑key schemes, depends on a specific asymmetry between
multiplication and factorization. Multiplying two large primes is computationally
straightforward, even when the numbers have hundreds of digits. Reversing the
product—discovering the two primes that generated it—appears to require far more work as the
numbers grow. RSA uses this asymmetry by choosing two large primes, multiplying them to form
a modulus, and publishing that modulus as part of the public key. A sender can then encrypt
a message using a public exponent, producing a cipher that can be reversed efficiently only
if one knows a corresponding private exponent tied to the primes’ hidden structure.

The scheme’s security is not based on secrecy of the algorithm; it is based on secrecy of
the private key. That design choice matters operationally. If the mathematics is public,
implementations can be tested and scrutinized, and security does not collapse when an
adversary learns how encryption works. What must be protected is the private exponent and
the primes that make it possible to compute. [A] If those primes are generated poorly—too
small, predictable, or reused—then the asymmetry weakens and the private key can be
reconstructed.

Public‑key cryptography also changed how trust is managed. If anyone can publish a public
key, how does a user know the key belongs to the intended website rather than to an
impersonator? The practical solution is not to abandon public keys but to bind them to
identities through certificates. A certificate authority signs a statement that a particular
public key corresponds to a particular domain, and browsers verify that signature. This does
not eliminate trust; it concentrates it. The system works well when authorities are careful
and transparent, but it can fail when an authority is compromised or coerced. [B] In such
cases, an attacker can present a “valid” certificate for a site they do not own, and users
may be deceived even though the mathematics is unbroken.

The computational landscape also changes over time. Key sizes once considered ample can
become inadequate as hardware and algorithms improve. A modulus that was difficult to factor
in 1995 can become tractable decades later, not because the number changed, but because
human capacity to search did. This is why cryptographic practice treats security as a moving
threshold rather than as a permanent label. [C] The same principle motivates interest in
post‑quantum cryptography: if a large-scale quantum computer were built, some factoring
problems would become much easier, forcing a shift toward schemes based on different hard
problems.

Yet even without futuristic machines, real-world failures often come from mundane causes. A
server might leak its private key through poor storage, a device might reuse a “random”
number that is not random, or a user might accept a warning and connect anyway. Public‑key
cryptography can make secure communication possible, but it cannot replace careful
engineering and cautious behavior. [D] Its conceptual achievement is nevertheless profound:
it turns an apparently circular problem— how to share a secret without a shared secret—into
a solvable one, by arranging mathematics so that locking is easy, unlocking is controlled,
and the private knowledge needed to unlock remains expensive to reconstruct.


Questions
---------

1. [Inference] What can be inferred from the passage about why public-key cryptography was conceptually important?
   A. It enabled two parties to establish secure communication without already sharing a secret key through a courier
   B. It eliminated the need for any private information in security systems
   C. It required that encryption algorithms be hidden to remain secure
   D. It made eavesdropping physically impossible on networks

2. [Vocabulary] The word “asymmetry” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. an imbalance in difficulty between two related tasks
   B. a secret agreement between users
   C. a type of certificate
   D. a stored password

3. [Factual] According to the passage, what mathematical property does RSA rely on?
   A. It relies on the idea that factoring a product of large primes is much harder than multiplying the primes
   B. It relies on the fact that prime numbers cannot be multiplied
   C. It relies on secret algorithms that cannot be examined publicly
   D. It relies on certificates that cannot be forged under any circumstances

4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In effect, the public key is a lock that can be built in public, while the key that opens it is never displayed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as ways security can fail EXCEPT:
   A. poor prime generation or reuse weakening the private key
   B. a compromised certificate authority issuing misleading certificates
   C. leaking private keys through careless storage
   D. ocean upwelling delivering nutrients to phytoplankton

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss certificate authorities?
   A. To show that trust in identities must be managed separately from the mathematics of encryption
   B. To argue that certificates replace private keys entirely
   C. To claim that browsers can factor large numbers automatically
   D. To suggest that RSA is secure only if certificates are secret

7. [Reference] In the sentence “The system works well when authorities are careful…,” what does “the system” refer to?
   A. multiplying two primes to create a modulus
   B. binding public keys to identities through signed certificates
   C. sending secrets by courier
   D. reusing the same random number repeatedly

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces the key-sharing problem, explains RSA’s mathematical idea, then expands to trust infrastructure and changing computational capacity, ending with practical failure modes
   B. It provides only equations and no explanation of trust
   C. It argues that algorithms must be hidden and ends there
   D. It focuses on quantum computers first and ignores RSA

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that security is “a moving threshold”?
   A. What is hard to break can change as computing power and algorithms improve, so key sizes must be updated
   B. Once a key is secure, it remains secure forever regardless of technology
   C. Security depends only on user behavior and never on computation
   D. Keys become weaker because the numbers themselves shrink over time

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. RSA makes secrecy unnecessary because public keys reveal private keys instantly.
   B. The passage explains how public-key cryptography, exemplified by RSA, uses a difficulty gap between multiplication and factoring to allow public locking with private unlocking, while noting that identity trust and real-world implementation choices strongly influence security over time.
   C. Secure communication is possible only through couriers because networks cannot be protected.
   D. Certificates eliminate the need for encryption by proving identity alone.
