Passage 0746: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 693)

In surface-science experiments, the analysis suggests researchers have treated rate
enhancement as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. DFT
surface modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that
such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting
debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, an outcome
that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

In replication attempts, the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were
applied in settings unlike industrial hydrogenation reactors. the same summary statistic
could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because catalyst deactivation
shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. Not treating rate enhancement as
a self-sufficient conclusion, but the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation
is granted, then the same observation—rate enhancement—must be paired with tests that change
the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat rate enhancement as
an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst deactivation
occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which DFT surface modeling constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Despite the fact that a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst deactivation did the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which DFT surface modeling constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value
of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Only after analysts began combining DFT surface modeling with cross-site comparisons did the
earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about heterogeneous catalysis on
platinum surfaces stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. [A] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is
inferred. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which rate
enhancement could be explained in more than one way because confounders like catalyst
deactivation often co-vary with the driver. [B] The author implies that replication is
informative only when protocols are comparable. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes whether
two analyses are actually comparable. [C] The passage returns to this point to clarify what
counts as evidence. [D] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather
than as an embarrassment. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even if
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which rate enhancement is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions
rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once structure-sensitive activity is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Because support interactions co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. it prevents structure-sensitive activity from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control support interactions
   D. Since structure-sensitive activity is observed in laboratory single-crystal studies, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in electrochemical interfaces and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because structure-sensitive activity uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on microkinetic modeling simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates support interactions.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that structure-sensitive activity is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving microkinetic modeling.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facet dependence can mimic structure-sensitive activity.
   D. The author treats industrial hydrogenation reactors as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **convergent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.
   A. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like microkinetic modeling are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because adsorbate coverage effects dominates all evidence
   D. coming together

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.
   A. microkinetic modeling as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. facet dependence alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. selectivity shifts specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that structure-sensitive activity is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how support interactions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from automotive catalytic converters. Finally, it maintains that tests combining DFT surface modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats DFT surface modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss structure-sensitive activity or support interactions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like support interactions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting DFT surface modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because structure-sensitive activity uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that support interactions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using DFT surface modeling are unnecessary.

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. poisoning by CO
   B. DFT surface modeling
   C. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   D. the author’s favorite color

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where temperature-programmed desorption constrains catalyst deactivation
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'metal-surface catalytic conversion' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   C. The author argues that temperature-programmed desorption should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The passage implies that automotive catalytic converters is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
