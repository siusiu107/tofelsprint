Passage 0032: Kelp Forests, Urchin Barrens, and the Predator–Grazer Switch (Ecology)
====================================================================================
(Word count: 616)

In cool coastal waters, kelp forests can look as stable as terrestrial woodlands: towering
fronds form a canopy, fish thread through shaded corridors, and sunlight filters down in
moving ribbons. Yet a kelp forest can also collapse into an “urchin barren,” a rocky
seascape carpeted with spiny grazers and dotted with little algae. The transition can occur
quickly, and reversing it can be surprisingly hard. The reason lies in a chain of causes
that links predators, grazing, and the physical architecture of the kelp itself.

Kelp are large brown algae that anchor to rock with a holdfast and grow rapidly when
nutrients and light are available. Because they grow from meristems near the base of the
blades, kelp can recover from small bites, but not from sustained scraping that removes
entire tissues. Sea urchins, equipped with a rasping mouthpart called Aristotle’s lantern,
can consume kelp blades, stipes, and even young recruits. When urchin densities are low,
kelp can outgrow grazing. When urchins become abundant, the balance flips. [A] Grazing is
then not a minor trimming; it becomes a bulldozer that prevents new kelp from establishing,
locking the system into a barren state.

Predators often keep urchins in check. In some regions, sea otters are a key predator,
cracking urchins and reducing their numbers. In others, lobsters and large fish play similar
roles. If predators are removed by hunting, habitat loss, or disease, urchin populations can
surge. The effect is not instantaneous everywhere, because kelp can persist for a time as a
legacy structure. But as old kelp dies and recruits fail, the canopy thins, and the habitat
that supported predators can shrink, further weakening control of urchins. A positive loop
emerges: fewer predators allow more urchins, which allows less kelp, which supports fewer
predators.

Storms and heat waves can supply the initial push. A severe storm can tear kelp from the
seafloor, creating open space that urchins can occupy. Marine heat waves can stress kelp by
reducing nutrient upwelling and by pushing temperatures toward physiological limits. Kelp
weakened by warm water is easier for urchins to overwhelm. [B] After the canopy is gone,
urchins can persist on small amounts of encrusting algae, so the system can remain in the
barren state even when conditions improve for kelp.

Restoration therefore targets both biology and structure. Removing urchins directly—by
harvesting or by manual culling— can create pockets where kelp recruits survive.
Reintroducing predators can, over longer times, reestablish control. However, predators
cannot recover if the habitat they need is absent, so restoration can require a sequence:
reduce urchins, allow kelp patches to form, then allow predators to return. Even then, kelp
recovery can be patchy because spores must arrive and settle, and because rocky surfaces can
be coated with organisms that inhibit kelp recruitment.

The transition also matters for carbon storage. Kelp forests export organic carbon when
detached fragments sink to deep water or are buried. Urchin barrens export less because
there is less biomass. Although kelp carbon is not a permanent sink in all cases, the
reduction of kelp can shift coastal carbon budgets and alter how nutrients cycle. [C] A
food-web change driven by predation can therefore ripple into biogeochemistry.

Kelp forests and urchin barrens show that ecosystems can have alternative states. The same
coastline, under similar temperatures and salinities, can support either a lush canopy or a
barren floor, depending on the balance of grazing and predation and on the history of recent
disturbances. [D] For coastal managers, the lesson is practical: protecting predators and
buffering ecosystems from extreme events can prevent collapse, while restoration must
address the specific mechanisms—urchin density, predator return, and kelp recruitment—that
hold a barren in place.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, what directly prevents kelp forests from reestablishing once urchins are abundant?
   A. Sustained grazing that removes recruits and keeps new kelp from establishing.
   B. Sustained grazing that removes recruits and keeps new kelp from establishing. This would require restoration to be the limiting factor.
   C. Sustained grazing that removes recruits and keeps new kelp from establishing by tying the effect to switch.
   D. Sustained grazing that removes recruits and keeps new kelp from establishing. This would require switch to be the limiting factor.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “legacy” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a type of seaweed spore
   B. a remaining structure from an earlier state
   C. a predator’s hunting tool
   D. a government regulation in sense


3. [Inference] What can be inferred about why predators may not recover quickly after kelp loss?
   A. The habitat that supports predators shrinks when canopy structure disappears.
   B. The habitat that supports predators shrinks when canopy structure disappears. This would require predation to be the limiting factor.
   C. The habitat that undermines predators shrinks when canopy structure disappears. This would require barrens to be the limiting factor.
   D. The habitat that supports nutrients shrinks when canopy structure disappears. This outcome would hold even if transition stays constant.

   C. predator disease or loss in this discussion.
   D. marine heat waves in this discussion.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss carbon export from kelp forests?
   A. To show that shifts in predator–grazer dynamics can influence broader biogeochemical processes by tying the effect to predation.
   B. To show that shifts in predator–grazer dynamics can influence broader biogeochemical processes.
   C. To show that shifts in predator–grazer dynamics can solely influence broader biogeochemical processes. This would occur only when switch dominates.
   D. To show that shifts in predator–grazer dynamics must influence broader biogeochemical processes. This outcome would hold even if food-web stays constant.


7. [Reference] In the passage, “the balance flips” refers to the point when:
   A. storms grazing outpaces kelp growth and prevents recruitment. This would require forests to be the limiting factor.
   B. urchin grazing outpaces kelp growth and prevents recruitment. This would occur only when transition dominates.
   C. urchin grazing outpaces kelp growth and prevents recruitment. This would require transition to be the limiting factor.
   D. urchin grazing outpaces kelp growth and prevents recruitment.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains the kelp–urchin shift by tracing mechanisms from grazing and predation to disturbance triggers, restoration strategies, and biogeochemical consequences. This outcome would hold even if switch stays constant.
   B. It explains the kelp–urchin shift by tracing mechanisms from grazing and predation to disturbance triggers, restoration strategies, and biogeochemical consequences.
   C. It explains the kelp–urchin shift by tracing mechanisms from grazing and predation to disturbance triggers, restoration strategies, and biogeochemical consequences. This outcome would hold even if urchin stays constant.
   D. It explains the kelp–ecosystems shift by tracing mechanisms from grazing and predation to disturbance triggers, restoration strategies, and biogeochemical consequences. That would make transition the primary constraint.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea of “alternative states” in this context?
   A. Similar environments can solely persist in different stable conditions depending on food-web interactions and history. That would make switch the primary constraint.
   B. Similar environments can persist in different stable conditions depending on food-web interactions and history.
   C. Similar environments must persist in different stable conditions depending on food-web interactions and history. This would occur only when transition dominates.
   D. Similar environments can persist in different stable conditions depending on ecology interactions and history. This would occur only when barrens dominates.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage describes how predator loss and disturbances can solely allow sea urchins to overgraze kelp, creating a self-reinforcing barren state that resists recovery, and explains why restoration must reduce urchins and rebuild habitat while noting broader effects such as altered coastal carbon export. This would require ecology to be the limiting factor.
   B. The passage describes how predator loss and disturbances can allow sea urchins to overgraze kelp, creating a self-reinforcing barren state that resists recovery, and explains why restoration must reduce urchins and rebuild habitat while noting broader effects such as altered coastal carbon export.
   C. The passage describes how predator loss and disturbances can allow sea urchins to overgraze kelp, creating a self-reinforcing barren state that resists recovery, and explains why nutrients must reduce urchins and rebuild habitat while noting broader effects such as altered coastal carbon export. This would occur only when urchin dominates.
   D. The passage describes how predator loss and disturbances can allow sea urchins to overgraze kelp, creating a self-reinforcing barren state that resists recovery, and explains why restoration must amplify urchins and rebuild habitat while noting broader effects such as altered coastal carbon export. This would occur only when temperatures dominates.
