Passage 0085: Methane Hydrates, Stability Zones, and Why Warming Seas Matter (Earth Science)
============================================================================================
(Word count: 615)

On continental margins where cold, high-pressure conditions prevail, methane can become
trapped in an unusual solid: methane hydrate. In this ice-like structure, water molecules
form cages that hold methane, creating a material that looks like packed snow yet can burn
if warmed because the released gas is flammable. Hydrates store enormous amounts of carbon,
and their stability depends on temperature and pressure; therefore, they have attracted
attention as both potential energy resources and potential climate hazards.

Hydrate stability is often depicted as a zone. At sufficient pressure and low enough
temperature, hydrates are stable within sediments; if conditions cross a threshold, hydrates
dissociate into water and methane gas. The base of the stability zone can be identified
geophysically because it can create a bottom-simulating reflector (BSR), a seismic
reflection that mimics the seafloor but marks a subsurface phase boundary. [A] The BSR is
not the hydrate itself, but it is a clue about where hydrates could exist.

Warming of bottom waters can shift that boundary upward. If ocean temperatures rise, the
stability zone thins, and hydrates near its base may dissociate. The released methane can
migrate upward through sediments, potentially forming gas pockets. Whether that methane
reaches the ocean and atmosphere depends on multiple filters: microbial oxidation can
consume methane; bubbles can dissolve before surfacing; and methane can be trapped again as
hydrate if it moves into colder layers. Still, in some settings, methane seepage is
observed, and carbonate crusts can form as a byproduct of microbial methane oxidation,
leaving durable geological evidence of past seep activity. [B] In this way, chemistry
translates a transient gas release into a rock record.

Hydrate dissociation also matters mechanically. When hydrate cement binds sediments, it can
increase strength; when hydrate melts, pore pressures can rise and strength can drop,
potentially destabilizing slopes. Submarine landslides have been proposed as one mechanism
by which hydrate change could trigger rapid sediment failure, though linking specific
landslides to hydrate collapse is difficult. A slope can fail due to earthquakes, rapid
sedimentation, or fluid overpressure unrelated to hydrates. Nonetheless, the possibility has
motivated careful monitoring of margins where warming is likely and where slopes are already
close to failure.

The climatic significance hinges on scale and timing. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas,
yet it is also relatively short-lived in the atmosphere compared with carbon dioxide. A
large, abrupt release could cause strong but temporary warming, whereas slow leakage might
be mostly oxidized before reaching air. Moreover, the deepest hydrates are insulated from
near-term temperature change; the more responsive hydrates are those in shallow waters and
upper sediments, which are smaller fractions of the global inventory. [C] The risk,
therefore, is not a single apocalyptic “hydrate bomb” everywhere at once, but a set of
regional responses that could still matter for local ecosystems and for greenhouse forcing.

Hydrates remind geoscientists that climate feedbacks can be stored in phase boundaries. [D]
A modest shift in ocean temperature can, over time, reorganize where carbon is locked in
solids and where it moves as gas, connecting deep sediments to surface climate in ways that
are indirect, delayed, and yet physically intelligible.

salts and methane change diffusion gradients.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, what is a bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) used to infer?
   A. The approximate boundary of the hydrate stability zone in sediments
   B. The exact age of seafloor basalts by annual layers
   C. The presence of ultramarine pigment in marine crusts
   D. The frequency of sleep spindles in dolphins

2. [Vocabulary] The word “dissociate” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. to break apart into methane gas and water as stability conditions are lost
   B. to migrate upward through sediments without change
   C. to freeze into a more stable hydrate form
   D. to oxidize methane into carbonate rock instantly

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because pressure increases with depth while temperature often increases more slowly, the stability field can extend far beneath the seafloor.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why carbonate crusts are important in hydrate-related studies?
   A. They can preserve evidence of methane seepage even after the original gas release has ended
   B. They indicate that methane always reaches the atmosphere without oxidation
   C. They prove that all submarine landslides are caused by hydrates
   D. They show that hydrates are stable at any temperature

   A. microbial oxidation consuming methane
   B. bubbles dissolving before surfacing
   C. methane being trapped again as hydrate in colder layers
   D. royal jelly shifting juvenile hormone levels

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author contrast a rapid methane release with slow leakage?
   A. To explain that climate impact depends on the rate of release because oxidation and atmospheric lifetime influence how much methane accumulates in air
   B. To argue that methane is weaker than carbon dioxide in all circumstances
   C. To claim that hydrate inventories are identical in all oceans
   D. To suggest that earthquakes cannot affect submarine slopes

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the deepest hydrates” refers to:
   A. hydrates located in deeper, better-insulated sediments less affected by near-term ocean warming
   B. hydrates that form only in river deltas at sea level
   C. a special hydrate type found inside tree trunks
   D. methane trapped in laboratory glassware

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It defines methane hydrates, explains stability and geophysical indicators, then discusses warming-driven dissociation, chemical and mechanical consequences, and finally evaluates climatic significance by emphasizing scale and timing
   B. It lists energy companies interested in drilling hydrates
   C. It focuses only on landslides and ignores methane chemistry
   D. It argues that hydrates are a myth because they burn

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the author’s view of “hydrate bomb” narratives?
   A. Global, instantaneous catastrophe is unlikely; instead, regional hydrate responses may occur and can still matter depending on conditions
   B. A single release will occur everywhere at once with identical magnitude
   C. Hydrates cannot change with temperature because pressure dominates
   D. Methane from hydrates is always harmless because it dissolves completely

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Methane hydrates are ordinary ice that cannot store gas and have no climate relevance.
   B. The passage explains methane hydrates as pressure- and temperature-dependent solids in marine sediments, describes how warming can thin the stability zone indicated by features like BSRs, outlines chemical and mechanical consequences of dissociation, and argues that climate risk depends on regional scale and release rates rather than a universal sudden catastrophe.
   C. Hydrate dissociation is presented as guaranteed to produce immediate atmospheric methane spikes worldwide.
   D. Carbonate crusts form only from volcanic sulfur and therefore cannot indicate methane seepage.
