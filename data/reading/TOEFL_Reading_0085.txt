Passage 0085: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 654)

From a cognitive-control perspective, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated increased liking for chosen options as the decisive sign of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization. Despite the fact that implicit
association tests can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain
why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Despite the fact that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
cultural norms about consistency can shift baselines, altering whether increased liking for
chosen options is even comparable across cases, an outcome that means that a good fit is not
the same as a good explanation. Unless cultural norms about consistency is changed while the
nominal driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are
perturbed cannot be claimed with confidence. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only through analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-site comparisons
could one reasonably claim that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which increased liking for chosen options
could be explained in more than one way because confounders like cultural norms about
consistency often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors
became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable.

Using implicit association tests under stable conditions, the key question becomes whether
one frequently cited case from workplace decision settings appeared to support the direct-
readout view. [A] The passage highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample
checks. Although the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis
showed that small shifts in cultural norms about consistency altered the baseline enough to
mute or mimic increased liking for chosen options. [B] The passage signals that a tidy fit
may hide degenerate explanations. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, an outcome
that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. [C] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid
overclaiming. [D] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows. In
this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

It is the apparent regularity of increased liking for chosen options that drives the first
interpretation: increased liking for chosen options is treated as a direct readout of
mechanism. If increased liking for chosen options is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway, a different prediction follows: then observations from workplace decision settings
would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. the literature is full
of such claims, not because the caveat that cultural norms about consistency might reproduce
the same pattern, but because the assumptions differ. In this sense, self-justification
mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Despite
the fact that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the
result is a framework in which increased liking for chosen options is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This is why the author dwells on assumptions: without them, two teams can analyze the same record and still disagree honestly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **tentative** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like behavioral priming designs are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because self-concept threat dominates all evidence
   C. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   D. not certain

3. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. Because increased liking for chosen options appears, the mechanism must be unique, so measurement reactivity can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. Since increased liking for chosen options is observed in political opinion panels, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. it prevents increased liking for chosen options from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity
   D. Because measurement reactivity co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using choice-induced preference paradigms.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away cultural norms about consistency, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when cultural norms about consistency can mimic shifted confidence judgments.
   D. The author treats political opinion panels as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal attitude surveys with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   B. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal attitude surveys are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal attitude surveys as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal attitude surveys as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where choice-induced preference paradigms constrains self-concept threat
   B. The author argues that choice-induced preference paradigms should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The discussion suggests that self-concept threat is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'dissonance reduction after decisions' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on choice-induced preference paradigms simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates cultural norms about consistency.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies one mechanism.

8. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. choice-induced preference paradigms
   B. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   C. shifted confidence judgments
   D. the length of the Nile in miles
