Passage 0085: Methane Hydrates, Stability Zones, and Why Warming Seas Matter (Earth Science)
============================================================================================
(Word count: 615)

On continental margins where cold, high-pressure conditions prevail, methane can become
trapped in an unusual solid: methane hydrate. In this ice-like structure, water molecules
form cages that hold methane, creating a material that looks like packed snow yet can burn
if warmed because the released gas is flammable. Hydrates store enormous amounts of carbon,
and their stability depends on temperature and pressure; therefore, they have attracted
attention as both potential energy resources and potential climate hazards.

Hydrate stability is often depicted as a zone. At sufficient pressure and low enough
temperature, hydrates are stable within sediments; if conditions cross a threshold, hydrates
dissociate into water and methane gas. The base of the stability zone can be identified
geophysically because it can create a bottom-simulating reflector (BSR), a seismic
reflection that mimics the seafloor but marks a subsurface phase boundary. [A] The BSR is
not the hydrate itself, but it is a clue about where hydrates could exist.

Warming of bottom waters can shift that boundary upward. If ocean temperatures rise, the
stability zone thins, and hydrates near its base may dissociate. The released methane can
migrate upward through sediments, potentially forming gas pockets. Whether that methane
reaches the ocean and atmosphere depends on multiple filters: microbial oxidation can
consume methane; bubbles can dissolve before surfacing; and methane can be trapped again as
hydrate if it moves into colder layers. Still, in some settings, methane seepage is
observed, and carbonate crusts can form as a byproduct of microbial methane oxidation,
leaving durable geological evidence of past seep activity. [B] In this way, chemistry
translates a transient gas release into a rock record.

Hydrate dissociation also matters mechanically. When hydrate cement binds sediments, it can
increase strength; when hydrate melts, pore pressures can rise and strength can drop,
potentially destabilizing slopes. Submarine landslides have been proposed as one mechanism
by which hydrate change could trigger rapid sediment failure, though linking specific
landslides to hydrate collapse is difficult. A slope can fail due to earthquakes, rapid
sedimentation, or fluid overpressure unrelated to hydrates. Nonetheless, the possibility has
motivated careful monitoring of margins where warming is likely and where slopes are already
close to failure.

The climatic significance hinges on scale and timing. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas,
yet it is also relatively short-lived in the atmosphere compared with carbon dioxide. A
large, abrupt release could cause strong but temporary warming, whereas slow leakage might
be mostly oxidized before reaching air. Moreover, the deepest hydrates are insulated from
near-term temperature change; the more responsive hydrates are those in shallow waters and
upper sediments, which are smaller fractions of the global inventory. [C] The risk,
therefore, is not a single apocalyptic “hydrate bomb” everywhere at once, but a set of
regional responses that could still matter for local ecosystems and for greenhouse forcing.

Hydrates remind geoscientists that climate feedbacks can be stored in phase boundaries. [D]
A modest shift in ocean temperature can, over time, reorganize where carbon is locked in
solids and where it moves as gas, connecting deep sediments to surface climate in ways that
are indirect, delayed, and yet physically intelligible.

In sediment cores, hydrate-bearing layers can leave a signature in pore-water chemistry, as
salts and methane change diffusion gradients.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] A modest shift in ocean temperature can, over time, reorganize where carbon is locked in solids and where it moves as gas, connecting deep sediments to surface climate in ways that are indirect, delayed, and yet physically intelligible.
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to hydrate and hydrates
   C. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across change
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of change

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that hydrate is often incomplete and concludes that methane cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since change overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of hydrates with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage presents hydrates as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once hydrate is observed, competing explanations for methane collapse. It treats change as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage explains methane by linking hydrate to hydrates, and it shows why change changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage surveys methane but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed hydrates first, with hydrate serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats change as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, especially regarding methane.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in change, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of hydrate is enough to validate hydrates for methane, especially regarding chemistry, especially regarding chemistry.
   B. The passage implies that change mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes hydrate effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of hydrates no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain methane, especially regarding hydrates.
   C. The passage treats hydrate primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over hydrates are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about methane are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how methane should change if change is altered, instead of assuming that hydrate has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to hydrates must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of change as a factor influencing hydrate, in the examples provided.
   B. discussion of hydrates as a factor influencing hydrate
   C. discussion of methane as a factor influencing hydrate
   D. discussion of epigenetic imprinting as a factor influencing hydrate

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] A modest shift in ocean temperature can, over time, reorganize where carbon is locked in solids and where it moves as gas, connecting deep sediments to surface climate in ways that are indirect, delayed, and yet physically intelligible.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   B. [D] A modest shift in ocean temperature can. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   D. [D] A modest shift in ocean temperature can. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents hydrates from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold change constant while examining hydrate.
   B. Because hydrate directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding methane.
   C. Because the presence of hydrates guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in change are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because once hydrate fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and change can be ignored without changing conclusions about methane.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | hydrate | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | change | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It proves hydrates is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that methane should be read alongside change, because hydrate alone does not settle what hydrates means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: In this ice-like structure, water molecules form cages that hold methane, creating a material that looks like packed snow yet can burn if warmed because the released gas is flammable.
   A. the idea that On continental margins where cold, high-pressure conditions prevail, methane can become trapped in an unusual solid: methane hydrate
   B. the idea that In sediment cores, hydrate-bearing layers can leave a signature in pore-water chemistry, as salts and methane change diffusion gradients
   C. the idea that Hydrates store enormous amounts of carbon, and their stability depends on temperature and pressure; therefore, they have attracted attention as both potential energy resources...
   D. the idea that [B] In this way, chemistry translates a transient gas release into a rock record, in the setting discussed.
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses hydrates, so debate over hydrate is unnecessary noise, in the setting discussed.
   B. to show that the term methane belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of hydrate and hydrates should be abandoned altogether, as the discussion implies.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of hydrate lead to different conclusions about methane.
