Passage 0938: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 763)

When the same target is reobserved, researchers have treated apparent slopes mimicking
Rayleigh scattering as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
Even if simultaneous photometric monitoring can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than
rely on familiar narratives. Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify
instrument drift across visits did the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. [A] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with
what is inferred. by comparing cases in which simultaneous photometric monitoring constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces
analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. [B] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. Though
a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. [C] This becomes a pivot point where the
earlier interpretation is narrowed. [D] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the
author frames it as conditional. In this sense, unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In replication
attempts, it becomes plausible that the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols
were applied in settings unlike active K-dwarf host stars. the same summary statistic could
be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because instrument drift across
visits shifted the baseline in different directions across sites, which is why replication
matters. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating
apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because
the assumptions differ. It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline
feature, that the passage presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one
wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the same observation—apparent
slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering—must be paired with tests that change the conditions
under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh
scattering as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions.
Only after analysts began combining simultaneous photometric monitoring with cross-site
comparisons did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about stellar
contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying on a single figure and started relying
on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which apparent slopes
mimicking Rayleigh scattering could be explained in more than one way largely because
confounders like instrument drift across visits often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
which changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, activity-driven
spectral distortion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify instrument
drift across visits. by comparing cases in which simultaneous photometric monitoring
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an
outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value
of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. Rarely, unless
analysts began combining simultaneous photometric monitoring with cross-site comparisons,
does one see why claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying
on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering could be explained in
more than one way largely because confounders like instrument drift across visits often co-
vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, which changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, it becomes
plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the
evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.
   A. time-variable spectral baselines specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. limb-darkening model mismatch alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. multi-epoch transit campaigns as a device rather than as an analytic approach

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like instrument drift across visits make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting spot–facular forward modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that time-variable spectral baselines is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how instrument drift across visits can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from active K-dwarf host stars. Finally, it maintains that tests combining spot–facular forward modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats spot–facular forward modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss time-variable spectral baselines or instrument drift across visits. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that instrument drift across visits is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using spot–facular forward modeling are unnecessary.

3. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents spurious molecular detections from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control limb-darkening model mismatch
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if spot–facular forward modeling produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. Because limb-darkening model mismatch co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. The passage implies that spot–facular forward modeling directly measures causes, meaning confounding from limb-darkening model mismatch is impossible.

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the goal was to break degeneracies in which apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like instrument drift across visits often co-vary with the driver.
   A. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like simultaneous photometric monitoring are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because facula coverage fractions dominates all evidence
   D. important

5. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using spot–facular forward modeling.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away facula coverage fractions, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The passage suggests that spurious molecular detections is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facula coverage fractions can mimic spurious molecular detections.

6. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Gaussian-process detrending
   B. the price of coal in 1700
   C. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy
   D. rotation-modulated light curves

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | Gaussian-process detrending | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | time-variable spectral baselines | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | facula coverage fractions | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Samples only part of the system
   B. Can mimic the target feature
   C. It replaces Gaussian-process detrending with intuition.
   D. It proves rotation-modulated light curves is unique.

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: Only after analysts began combining simultaneous photometric monitoring with cross-site comparisons did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in M-dwarf systems with repeated transits and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on spot–facular forward modeling simple.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates starspot temperature contrasts.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies one mechanism.

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where simultaneous photometric monitoring constrains facula coverage fractions
   B. The passage implies that bright nearby planet hosts is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
   D. The author argues that simultaneous photometric monitoring should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
