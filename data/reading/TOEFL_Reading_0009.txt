Passage 0009: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 799)

In twentieth-century urban histories, researchers found that researchers have treated shifts
in industrial labor demand as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. Despite the fact that newspaper archive research can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Only after analysts began
combining newspaper archive research with cross-site comparisons did claims about the great
migration and northern urban transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which shifts in
industrial labor demand could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
wartime industry demand often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as
the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In
this sense, african american internal migration is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label. The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is
stated, the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban
transformation: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A]
This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. Unless one wishes
to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—shifts in industrial
labor demand—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears
cannot be claimed with confidence. [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a
disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Whereas popular summaries treat shifts in industrial
labor demand as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. [C] The author uses the example
to separate detection from interpretation. [D] The author notes that generalization requires
more than a single well-chosen case. Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or
stratify wartime industry demand was it defensible to argue that the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which newspaper
archive research constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive
out of sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. Even though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. Hardly had analysts
began combining newspaper archive research with cross-site comparisons occurred when claims
about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped relying on a single
figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in
which shifts in industrial labor demand could be explained in more than one way because, as
the author notes, confounders like wartime industry demand often co-vary with the driver. as
the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Rarely has it been the case that the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical, at least before the
field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify wartime industry demand. by comparing cases
in which newspaper archive research constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative design
over isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike Detroit. the same summary statistic could
be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed in part because wartime industry
demand shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. Rather than treating
shifts in industrial labor demand as a self-sufficient conclusion, the passage emphasizes
that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense, twentieth-
century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label. In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most
informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.
by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps
explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats housing record reconstruction as a historical curiosity and does not discuss segregation and redlining signatures or racial violence and intimidation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because segregation and redlining signatures uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that racial violence and intimidation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using housing record reconstruction are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that segregation and redlining signatures is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how racial violence and intimidation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Philadelphia. Finally, it maintains that tests combining housing record reconstruction with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   D. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like racial violence and intimidation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting housing record reconstruction as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

2. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. newspaper archive research as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. changes in neighborhood composition specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. wartime industry demand alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. housing record reconstruction
   B. a list of Olympic medal counts
   C. segregation and redlining signatures
   D. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation

4. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that model assumptions is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that census microdata analysis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from housing covenants and policy constraints is impossible.
   B. it prevents shifts in industrial labor demand from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control housing covenants and policy constraints
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifts in industrial labor demand is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if census microdata analysis produces a tight fit on one dataset.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because segregation and redlining signatures uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates housing covenants and policy constraints.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on oral history synthesis simple.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Detroit and everywhere else.

6. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage suggests that changes in neighborhood composition is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when wartime industry demand can mimic changes in neighborhood composition.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving oral history synthesis.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away wartime industry demand, since variability is merely a measurement error.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The author argues that housing record reconstruction should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'African American internal migration' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   C. The discussion suggests that housing covenants and policy constraints is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where housing record reconstruction constrains housing covenants and policy constraints
