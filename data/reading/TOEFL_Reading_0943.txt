Passage 0943: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 714)

Despite seemingly clear effect sizes, researchers have treated shifted confidence judgments
as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization. Granted that
behavioral priming designs can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues
that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, a
move that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity was
it defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which behavioral priming designs constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single
case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, post-choice attitude
change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from description to
explanation to fail, then the same observation—shifted confidence judgments—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries
treat shifted confidence judgments as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it
as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically
revealing.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on measurement reactivity, the passage
suggests many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization as
a single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are
tested. Whereas those studies emphasized shifted confidence judgments as a signature looks
decisive, later work asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines
differ becomes more predictive under replication. [B] That point is not rhetorical; it
controls which prediction follows. The passage argues that this shift mattered for how
evidence from cross-national survey samples was generalized because local conditions can
change which processes generate shifted confidence judgments. [C] Later comparisons reveal
why this matters. [D] The author suggests that the same evidence can support multiple
stories when priors differ. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Using behavioral priming designs under stable conditions, the interpretation shifts, and one
frequently cited case from cross-national survey samples appeared to support the direct-
readout view. While it is true that the original fit looked visually decisive, later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in measurement reactivity altered the baseline
enough to mute or mimic shifted confidence judgments. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, a move that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted.

Seldom, prior to analysts began combining behavioral priming designs with cross-site
comparisons, did investigators concede that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which shifted confidence
judgments could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like
measurement reactivity often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes
whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Despite the fact that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer
is strong, the result is a framework in which shifted confidence judgments is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using behavioral priming designs are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting behavioral priming designs as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining behavioral priming designs with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats behavioral priming designs as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **plausible** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.
   A. reasonable
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like implicit association tests are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because self-concept threat dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

5. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that longitudinal attitude surveys directly measures causes, meaning confounding from measurement reactivity is impossible.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if longitudinal attitude surveys produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. Since selective memory for supporting evidence is observed in cross-national survey samples, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity

   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in workplace decision settings and everywhere else.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates cultural norms about consistency.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on choice-induced preference paradigms simple.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
