Passage 0892: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 774)

In classic laboratory tasks, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated selective memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization. Even if implicit association tests
can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is
conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about
data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Rarely
has it been the case that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions, at least before analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-
site comparisons. the goal was to break degeneracies in which selective memory for
supporting evidence could be explained in more than one way because, as the author notes,
confounders like public versus private commitment often co-vary with the driver. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. Only through analysts began combining implicit
association tests with cross-site comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure
and started relying on falsifiable predictions. [A] This detail becomes important later,
when assumptions are tested. the goal was to break degeneracies in which selective memory
for supporting evidence could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
public versus private commitment often co-vary with the driver. [B] This is why the author
repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which
helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. [C] Later
comparisons reveal why this matters. [D] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of
inference rather than as an embarrassment. Using implicit association tests under stable
conditions, the interpretation shifts, and one frequently cited case from consumer choice
studies appeared to support the direct-readout view. Despite the fact that the original fit
looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in public
versus private commitment altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic selective memory for
supporting evidence. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic; this, in turn,
illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted.
Although the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how public versus
private commitment can shift baselines, altering whether selective memory for supporting
evidence is even comparable across cases, a move that means that a good fit is not the same
as a good explanation. If public versus private commitment is changed while the nominal
driver remains constant is granted, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are
perturbed. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. It is the apparent regularity of
selective memory for supporting evidence, rather than a single headline feature, that drives
the first interpretation: selective memory for supporting evidence is treated as a direct
readout of mechanism. Provided that selective memory for supporting evidence is uniquely
produced by one causal pathway, then observations from consumer choice studies would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. the literature is full of such
claims, not because the caveat that public versus private commitment might reproduce the
same pattern, but because the assumptions differ. The point is not X but methodological
humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same
observation—selective memory for supporting evidence—must be paired with tests that change
the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular
summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an endpoint may be convenient,
the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts is scientifically revealing. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, the analysis
suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that
forces competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Using implicit association tests under stable conditions, the interpretation shifts, and one frequently cited case from consumer choice studies appeared to support the direct-readout view.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because self-concept threat dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like behavioral priming designs are needed
   C. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   D. unclear

2. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested.
   A. meta-analytic synthesis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. public versus private commitment alone, treated as the sole cause

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the author’s favorite color
   B. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   C. selective memory for supporting evidence
   D. meta-analytic synthesis

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | meta-analytic synthesis | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | selective memory for supporting evidence | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | self-concept threat | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Can mimic the target feature
   B. It replaces implicit association tests with intuition.
   C. Can be contaminated by background variability
   D. It makes public versus private commitment irrelevant.

5. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once increased liking for chosen options is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. The passage implies that meta-analytic synthesis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from public versus private commitment is impossible.
   C. it prevents increased liking for chosen options from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
   D. Since increased liking for chosen options is observed in cross-national survey samples, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: Rarely has it been the case that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions, at least before analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-site comparisons.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates public versus private commitment.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-national survey samples and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on meta-analytic synthesis simple.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The passage implies that 'noise' is sometimes a label for unmodeled structure rather than a property of the world itself.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using implicit association tests.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic devaluation of rejected alternatives.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away public versus private commitment, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The passage suggests that devaluation of rejected alternatives is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using meta-analytic synthesis are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats meta-analytic synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss devaluation of rejected alternatives or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting meta-analytic synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that devaluation of rejected alternatives is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining meta-analytic synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing theories?
   A. The discussion suggests that public versus private commitment is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The passage treats increased liking for chosen options as a confounder and public versus private commitment as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'attitude reconfiguration following commitment' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where behavioral priming designs constrains public versus private commitment
