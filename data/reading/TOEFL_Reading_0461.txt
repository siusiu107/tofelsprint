Passage 0461: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 712)

In classic laboratory tasks, the analysis suggests researchers have treated selective memory
for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. Granted that behavioral priming designs can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

If anything is responsible, it is the apparent regularity of selective memory for supporting
evidence, and therefore drives the first interpretation: selective memory for supporting
evidence is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. If selective memory for supporting
evidence is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then observations from workplace
decision settings would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. the
literature is full of such claims—not the caveat that measurement reactivity might reproduce
the same pattern. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity
could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which behavioral priming designs constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, a move that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

In replication attempts, it becomes plausible that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike workplace decision settings. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed in part
because measurement reactivity shifted the baseline in different directions across sites.
the author therefore separates detection from interpretation—not treating selective memory
for supporting evidence as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, dissonance reduction
after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move
from description to explanation, then the same observation—selective memory for supporting
evidence—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an endpoint may
be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is scientifically revealing.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The discussion treats
exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation holds, then the same observation—selective memory for supporting
evidence—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B]
The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. Whereas popular summaries treat
selective memory for supporting evidence as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is
scientifically revealing. [C] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate
explanations. [D] The author uses the example to separate detection from interpretation. In
this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Although the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which selective memory for supporting evidence is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that selective memory for supporting evidence is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic selective memory for supporting evidence.
   C. The author treats workplace decision settings as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away public versus private commitment, since variability is merely a measurement error.

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on meta-analytic synthesis simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It replaces behavioral priming designs with intuition.
   B. Can introduce systematic bias
   C. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   D. May be muted by other processes

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: If anything is responsible, it is the apparent regularity of selective memory for supporting evidence, and therefore drives the first interpretation: selective memory for supporting evidence is treated as a direct readout of mechanism.
   A. self-concept threat alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. choice-induced preference paradigms as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. shifted confidence judgments specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

   Sentence: In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. lasting
   B. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like choice-induced preference paradigms are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because cultural norms about consistency dominates all evidence

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal attitude surveys constrains measurement reactivity
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'self-justification mechanisms' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   C. The passage treats shifted confidence judgments as a confounder and measurement reactivity as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The author argues that longitudinal attitude surveys should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

9. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. Because measurement reactivity co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifted confidence judgments is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if implicit association tests produces a tight fit on one dataset.

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats implicit association tests as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifted confidence judgments or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using implicit association tests are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting implicit association tests as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that shifted confidence judgments is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining implicit association tests with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
