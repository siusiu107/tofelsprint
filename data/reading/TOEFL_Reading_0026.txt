Passage 0026: Gifts, Reciprocity, and How Obligation Builds Social Networks (Anthropology)
==========================================================================================
(Word count: 611)

In many societies, gifts are not treated as simple transfers of property. A gift can carry a
social weight that lingers after the object has changed hands, shaping who is allied with
whom, who is respected, and who is indebted. To outsiders accustomed to cash transactions,
this can look irrational: why give away valuable goods and then spend months preparing a
return gift? Yet gift exchange can function as a system for building relationships when
there is no centralized authority to enforce contracts. The object matters, but the social
bond it creates can matter more.

A gift generates obligation through three linked expectations: to give, to receive, and to
reciprocate. To refuse a gift is often to refuse the relationship the giver proposes. To
accept is to acknowledge that relationship, which can be both honor and burden. Reciprocity,
meanwhile, is not merely repayment; it is a way of proving that one can meet social duties
and maintain status. [A] In this sense, gifts are instruments for ranking as well as for
bonding: the capacity to give signals resources and generosity, while the capacity to
reciprocate signals competence and dignity.

The timing of reciprocity is crucial. If a return is immediate and equal, the exchange
resembles barter and the social distance between parties can remain. If the return is
delayed, the relationship stays “open,” keeping parties connected through mutual awareness.
Delay can therefore be strategic: it allows obligations to circulate and reputations to
grow. At the same time, delay can be risky. If a recipient cannot reciprocate, the imbalance
can harden into dependence, giving the original giver leverage in future disputes.

Gift systems also manage scarcity and surplus. In environments where food harvests
fluctuate, redistributing goods through ritualized giving can help buffer households against
bad seasons. But the buffering is not anonymous. A household that receives help may owe
labor, political support, or future goods to the household that gave. [B] The system is thus
both economic and moral. It makes survival more likely, yet it ties survival to social ties
that can be unequal.

Because gifts are public performances, they can become arenas for competition. Ceremonial
exchanges may involve dramatic displays of wealth precisely because the audience must
witness the giver’s capacity. In some cases, givers may even destroy goods to demonstrate
that they can afford loss, converting material waste into prestige. Such actions can look
like madness if one measures success only by accumulation. Within the logic of the system,
however, prestige is a form of capital. It can translate into followers, marriage alliances,
or influence in decision-making councils.

Modern economies have not abolished gift logic; they have relocated it. Corporate
philanthropy, holiday presents, and social media giveaways can all create expectations of
goodwill and future support. Even in workplaces where salaries are explicit, favors and
mentoring can create informal debts. The form changes, but the causal mechanism remains: a
transfer that cannot be reduced to price can generate relationships that persist beyond the
moment.

Thus, a gift is best understood not as a free object, but as a social act with consequences.
[C] It invites a response, and that invitation can organize communities by weaving
households into networks of mutual obligation. [D] Where law and contracts are weak or
distant, gifts can serve as a practical technology for cooperation, proving that what looks
like generosity on the surface can be, at the same time, a durable architecture of social
life.

When obligations circulate widely, cooperation can persist without constant bargaining,
because the expectations are learned early and enforced socially.

Questions
---------
1. [Inference] What can be inferred from the passage about why delayed reciprocity can be strategic?
   A. It keeps the builds open by maintaining an ongoing obligation and connection. That would make networks the primary constraint.
   B. It keeps the relationship open by maintaining an ongoing obligation and connection. This would occur only when builds dominates.
   C. It keeps the relationship open by maintaining an ongoing obligation and connection.
   D. It keeps the relationship open by maintaining an ongoing obligation and connection. This would occur only when household dominates.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “arena” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a seasonal harvest in sense
   B. a storage container in sense
   C. a legal document in sense
   D. a setting for competition


3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The social cost of rejecting such a proposal can be higher than the material value of the object itself.
   A. [D]
   B. [A]
   C. [C]
   D. [B]


4. [Factual] According to the passage, which trio of expectations helps create obligation in gift exchange?
   A. to give, to receive, and to reciprocate.
   B. to give, to receive, and to households. That would make household the primary constraint.
   C. to give, to receive, and to reciprocate. This would occur only when networks dominates.
   D. to give, to receive, and to reciprocate. This outcome would hold even if obligation stays constant.


5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention the destruction of goods in ceremonial exchanges?
   A. To illustrate how prestige can be generated through visible displays that defy accumulation-based logic.
   B. To illustrate how prestige can only be generated through visible displays that defy accumulation-based logic. That would make generosity the primary constraint.
   C. To illustrate how prestige can be generated through visible displays that defy accumulation-based logic by tying the effect to anthropology.
   D. To illustrate how prestige can solely be generated through visible displays that defy accumulation-based logic. This would require where to be the limiting factor.


6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as possible outcomes of gift obligations EXCEPT:
   A. political support in this discussion.
   B. gravitational lensing of starlight.
   C. marriage alliances in this discussion.
   D. labor owed in the future.


7. [Reference] In the passage, “the system” in “the system is thus both economic and moral” refers to:
   A. ritualized redistribution through gift exchange and its attached obligations. This would occur only when household dominates.
   B. ritualized redistribution through gift exchange and its attached household. This outcome would hold even if gifts stays constant.
   C. ritualized redistribution through gift exchange and its attached obligations. This would require gifts to be the limiting factor.
   D. ritualized redistribution through gift exchange and its attached obligations.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains why gifts carry social weight, describes reciprocity and timing, shows buffering and competition, then connects the logic to modern examples. This would require obligations to be the limiting factor.
   B. It explains why gifts carry social weight, describes obligations and timing, shows buffering and competition, then connects the logic to modern examples.
   C. It explains why gifts carry social weight, describes obligations and timing, shows buffering and competition, then connects the logic to modern examples. This would require reciprocate to be the limiting factor.
   D. It explains why gifts carry social weight, describes obligations and timing, shows buffering and competition, then connects the logic to modern examples. This would occur only when expectations dominates.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that gifts can be a “technology for cooperation”?
   A. They create enforceable relationships through mutual relationship when formal contracts are limited. That would make anthropology the primary constraint.
   B. They create enforceable relationships through mutual obligation when formal contracts are limited. This would occur only when household dominates.
   C. They create enforceable relationships through mutual obligation when formal contracts are limited.
   D. They create enforceable relationships through mutual obligation when formal contracts are solely limited. This would require networks to be the limiting factor.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage explains that gift exchange creates durable obligations to give, receive, and relationship, using timing and public display to build bonds and status, buffering scarcity while also enabling inequality, and showing that gift logic persists in modern settings. This would require relationships to be the limiting factor.
   B. The passage explains that gift exchange creates durable obligations to give, receive, and reciprocate, using timing and public display to build bonds and status, buffering scarcity while also enabling inequality, and showing that gift logic persists in modern settings. That would make relationship the primary constraint.
   C. The passage explains that gift exchange creates durable obligations to give, receive, and reciprocate, using timing and public display to build bonds and status, buffering scarcity while also enabling inequality, and showing that gift logic persists in modern settings. That would make where the primary constraint.
   D. The passage explains that gift exchange creates durable obligations to give, receive, and reciprocate, using timing and public display to build bonds and status, buffering scarcity while also enabling inequality, and showing that gift logic persists in modern settings.
