Passage 0026: Gifts, Reciprocity, and How Obligation Builds Social Networks (Anthropology)
==========================================================================================
(Word count: 611)

In many societies, gifts are not treated as simple transfers of property. A gift can carry a
social weight that lingers after the object has changed hands, shaping who is allied with
whom, who is respected, and who is indebted. To outsiders accustomed to cash transactions,
this can look irrational: why give away valuable goods and then spend months preparing a
return gift? Yet gift exchange can function as a system for building relationships when
there is no centralized authority to enforce contracts. The object matters, but the social
bond it creates can matter more.

A gift generates obligation through three linked expectations: to give, to receive, and to
reciprocate. To refuse a gift is often to refuse the relationship the giver proposes. To
accept is to acknowledge that relationship, which can be both honor and burden. Reciprocity,
meanwhile, is not merely repayment; it is a way of proving that one can meet social duties
and maintain status. [A] In this sense, gifts are instruments for ranking as well as for
bonding: the capacity to give signals resources and generosity, while the capacity to
reciprocate signals competence and dignity.

The timing of reciprocity is crucial. If a return is immediate and equal, the exchange
resembles barter and the social distance between parties can remain. If the return is
delayed, the relationship stays “open,” keeping parties connected through mutual awareness.
Delay can therefore be strategic: it allows obligations to circulate and reputations to
grow. At the same time, delay can be risky. If a recipient cannot reciprocate, the imbalance
can harden into dependence, giving the original giver leverage in future disputes.

Gift systems also manage scarcity and surplus. In environments where food harvests
fluctuate, redistributing goods through ritualized giving can help buffer households against
bad seasons. But the buffering is not anonymous. A household that receives help may owe
labor, political support, or future goods to the household that gave. [B] The system is thus
both economic and moral. It makes survival more likely, yet it ties survival to social ties
that can be unequal.

Because gifts are public performances, they can become arenas for competition. Ceremonial
exchanges may involve dramatic displays of wealth precisely because the audience must
witness the giver’s capacity. In some cases, givers may even destroy goods to demonstrate
that they can afford loss, converting material waste into prestige. Such actions can look
like madness if one measures success only by accumulation. Within the logic of the system,
however, prestige is a form of capital. It can translate into followers, marriage alliances,
or influence in decision-making councils.

Modern economies have not abolished gift logic; they have relocated it. Corporate
philanthropy, holiday presents, and social media giveaways can all create expectations of
goodwill and future support. Even in workplaces where salaries are explicit, favors and
mentoring can create informal debts. The form changes, but the causal mechanism remains: a
transfer that cannot be reduced to price can generate relationships that persist beyond the
moment.

Thus, a gift is best understood not as a free object, but as a social act with consequences.
[C] It invites a response, and that invitation can organize communities by weaving
households into networks of mutual obligation. [D] Where law and contracts are weak or
distant, gifts can serve as a practical technology for cooperation, proving that what looks
like generosity on the surface can be, at the same time, a durable architecture of social
life.

When obligations circulate widely, cooperation can persist without constant bargaining,
because the expectations are learned early and enforced socially.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [D] Where law and contracts are weak or distant, gifts can serve as a practical technology for cooperation, proving that what looks like generosity on the surface can be, at the same time, a durable architecture of social life.
   A. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of expectations
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to gifts and goods
   C. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across expectations
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents goods as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once gifts is observed, competing explanations for social collapse. It treats expectations as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   B. The passage surveys social but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed goods first, with gifts serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats expectations as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, in the cases described.
   C. The passage explains social by linking gifts to goods, and it shows why expectations changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage concedes that gifts is often incomplete and concludes that social cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since expectations overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of goods with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in expectations, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of gifts is enough to validate goods for social.
   B. The passage implies that expectations mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes gifts effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of goods no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain social, in the setting discussed.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how social should change if expectations is altered, instead of assuming that gifts has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to goods must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage treats gifts primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over goods are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about social are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, especially regarding social, in the setting discussed.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of goods as a factor influencing gifts
   B. discussion of social as a factor influencing gifts, especially regarding social.
   C. discussion of expectations as a factor influencing gifts
   D. discussion of contact-zone multilingualism as a factor influencing gifts

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: [D] Where law and contracts are weak or distant, gifts can serve as a practical technology for cooperation, proving that what looks like generosity on the surface can be, at the same time, a durable architecture of social life.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   B. [D] Where law and contracts are weak or distant. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. [D] Where law and contracts are weak or distant. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents goods from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold expectations constant while examining gifts.
   B. Because the presence of goods guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in expectations are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because once gifts fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and expectations can be ignored without changing conclusions about social.
   D. Because gifts directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding social.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | gifts | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | expectations | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves goods is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that social should be read alongside expectations, because gifts alone does not settle what goods means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: In many societies, gifts are not treated as simple transfers of property.
   A. the preceding claim that social functions as a direct measurement of goods
   B. the preceding claim that expectations alone explains the outcome of social
   C. the preceding claim that gifts is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   D. the preceding claim about how gifts is interpreted in relation to goods

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses goods, so debate over gifts is unnecessary noise, especially regarding object, especially regarding object.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of gifts lead to different conclusions about social.
   C. to show that the term social belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of gifts and goods should be abandoned altogether.
