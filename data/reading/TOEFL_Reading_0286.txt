Passage 0286: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 650)

Against that intuitive story, the passage argues that researchers have treated mobility
constraints across space as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence
of neighborhood inequality. While it is true that quasi-experimental policy evaluation can
make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is
conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about
data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit
that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike post-industrial cities. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely because
informational asymmetries in housing search shifted the baseline in different directions
across sites. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because
treating mobility constraints across space as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the
assumptions differ. In this sense, spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Should one
wishes to move from description to explanation be true, then the same observation—mobility
constraints across space—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat mobility constraints across space as an endpoint in
one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts in another.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify informational asymmetries
in housing search, does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. [A] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the
data cannot rule out. by comparing cases in which quasi-experimental policy evaluation
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an
outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B]
The author uses the example to separate detection from interpretation. a single case can be
dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier
interpretation is narrowed. [D] The passage highlights that mechanism claims must survive
out-of-sample checks. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify informational
asymmetries in housing search, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which quasi-experimental
policy evaluation constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive
out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome
that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any
story is arbitrary. Although the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is
strong, the result is a framework in which mobility constraints across space is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when path dependence from historical redlining can mimic school-quality gradients.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away path dependence from historical redlining, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The passage suggests that school-quality gradients is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving mobility tracking with administrative records.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the author’s favorite color
   B. spatial autocorrelation analysis
   C. wealth accumulation gaps
   D. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because wealth accumulation gaps uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates path dependence from historical redlining.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on spatial autocorrelation analysis simple.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in rapidly growing Sun Belt regions and everywhere else.

4. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that longitudinal panel data directly measures causes, meaning confounding from informational asymmetries in housing search is impossible.
   B. it prevents wealth accumulation gaps from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control informational asymmetries in housing search
   C. Since wealth accumulation gaps is observed in European migrant neighborhoods, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because informational asymmetries in housing search co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **subtle** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like quasi-experimental policy evaluation are needed
   B. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because zoning rules and land-use regulation dominates all evidence
   D. slight

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. wealth accumulation gaps specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. path dependence from historical redlining alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. spatial autocorrelation analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In short, the passage treats methodological humility as a strength, not as an admission of ignorance.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats mobility tracking with administrative records as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or path dependence from historical redlining. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how path dependence from historical redlining can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from European migrant neighborhoods. Finally, it maintains that tests combining mobility tracking with administrative records with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   C. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that path dependence from historical redlining is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using mobility tracking with administrative records are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting mobility tracking with administrative records as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

9. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | longitudinal panel data | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | school-quality gradients | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | credit market discrimination | Changes the apparent slope |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Can be contaminated by background variability
   B. Samples only part of the system
   C. It makes informational asymmetries in housing search irrelevant.
   D. It replaces longitudinal panel data with intuition.

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The passage treats disparate exposure to pollution as a confounder and zoning rules and land-use regulation as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The discussion suggests that zoning rules and land-use regulation is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal panel data constrains zoning rules and land-use regulation
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'urban sorting by race and income' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
