Passage 0915: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 718)

From a cognitive-control perspective, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated
devaluation of rejected alternatives as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization. Granted that implicit association tests can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify public versus private
commitment did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which implicit
association tests constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive
out of sample, a move that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny
the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this
sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same
observation—devaluation of rejected alternatives—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat devaluation of rejected
alternatives as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts.

In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike political opinion
panels. [A] The author uses the example to separate detection from interpretation. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely
because public versus private commitment shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. [B] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating them as
afterthoughts. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation—not treating
devaluation of rejected alternatives as a self-sufficient conclusion. [C] At first glance,
the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. [D] This becomes a pivot
point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. In this sense, dissonance reduction
after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Seldom, prior to analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-site
comparisons, did investigators concede that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which devaluation of rejected
alternatives could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like public
versus private commitment often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts
to admit that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify public versus private
commitment did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which implicit association tests constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic,
the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted
that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which devaluation of rejected alternatives is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. public versus private commitment alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. behavioral priming designs as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal attitude surveys as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal attitude surveys with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal attitude surveys as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal attitude surveys are unnecessary.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats consumer choice studies as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   B. The passage suggests that devaluation of rejected alternatives is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using meta-analytic synthesis.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when measurement reactivity can mimic devaluation of rejected alternatives.

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates cultural norms about consistency.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on behavioral priming designs simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the goal was to break degeneracies in which devaluation of rejected alternatives could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like public versus private commitment often co-vary with the driver.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like choice-induced preference paradigms are needed
   B. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because measurement reactivity dominates all evidence
   D. unclear

6. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The author notes that a single dramatic example can mislead if it is treated as representative rather than as diagnostic.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

7. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize model assumptions?
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if meta-analytic synthesis produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifted confidence judgments is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency
   D. Because shifted confidence judgments appears, the mechanism must be unique, so cultural norms about consistency can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

8. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | meta-analytic synthesis | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | selective memory for supporting evidence | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | public versus private commitment | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Can introduce systematic bias
   B. Can vary across epochs
   C. It makes cultural norms about consistency irrelevant.
   D. It proves devaluation of rejected alternatives is unique.

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. a recipe for bread fermentation
   B. choice-induced preference paradigms
   C. increased liking for chosen options
   D. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal attitude surveys constrains public versus private commitment
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'self-justification mechanisms' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   C. The author argues that longitudinal attitude surveys should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The passage treats shifted confidence judgments as a confounder and public versus private commitment as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
