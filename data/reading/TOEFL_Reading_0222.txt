Passage 0222: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 788)

When adoption is measured in aggregates, the passage argues that researchers have treated
disparate exposure to pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality. Although mobility tracking with administrative
records can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence
is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less
about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which is precisely why
forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from
historical redlining was it defensible to argue that the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which mobility tracking with
administrative records constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, a move that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this
sense, spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

Hardly had analysts began combining mobility tracking with administrative records with
cross-site comparisons occurred when claims about residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate
exposure to pollution could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders
like path dependence from historical redlining often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
which changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from
historical redlining could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which mobility tracking with
administrative records constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic;
nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality across
neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only through analysts began combining mobility tracking with administrative records with
cross-site comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about residential segregation
and the persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and
started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which
disparate exposure to pollution could be explained in more than one way largely because
confounders like path dependence from historical redlining often co-vary with the driver. as
the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The discussion treats
exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—disparate exposure to
pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B]
This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Whereas
popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint is easy to measure,
the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. [C] The passage returns to this point
to clarify what counts as evidence. [D] This reasoning matters because it changes what
counts as a decisive test. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why
the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. To
be sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, yet the
result is a framework in which disparate exposure to pollution is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. it prevents wealth accumulation gaps from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control zoning rules and land-use regulation
   B. Because zoning rules and land-use regulation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. The passage implies that spatial autocorrelation analysis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from zoning rules and land-use regulation is impossible.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if spatial autocorrelation analysis produces a tight fit on one dataset.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the price of coal in 1700
   B. audit studies in housing markets
   C. school-quality gradients
   D. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality

3. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving mobility tracking with administrative records.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away path dependence from historical redlining, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using mobility tracking with administrative records.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when path dependence from historical redlining can mimic disparate exposure to pollution.

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **subtle** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because path dependence from historical redlining dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   C. slight
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like audit studies in housing markets are needed

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. disparate exposure to pollution specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. zoning rules and land-use regulation alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. longitudinal panel data as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in European migrant neighborhoods and everywhere else.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates credit market discrimination.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because wealth accumulation gaps uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on spatial autocorrelation analysis simple.

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The author argues that longitudinal panel data should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal panel data constrains zoning rules and land-use regulation
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'persistent neighborhood-level disparities' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   D. The passage implies that European migrant neighborhoods is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because disparate exposure to pollution uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that informational asymmetries in housing search is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using spatial autocorrelation analysis are unnecessary.
   B. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that disparate exposure to pollution is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how informational asymmetries in housing search can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from rapidly growing Sun Belt regions. Finally, it maintains that tests combining spatial autocorrelation analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   C. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like informational asymmetries in housing search make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting spatial autocorrelation analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats spatial autocorrelation analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss disparate exposure to pollution or informational asymmetries in housing search. It ends without any methodological implication.
