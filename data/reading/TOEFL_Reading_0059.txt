Passage 0059: Stellar Metallicity and How Element Ratios Bias Planet Building (Astronomy)
=========================================================================================
(Word count: 619)

Astronomers often describe stars as “metal-rich” or “metal-poor,” using “metals” as
shorthand for all elements heavier than helium. This stellar metallicity is not a cosmetic
label; it reflects the chemical enrichment history of the galaxy. Early stars formed from
gas that contained mostly hydrogen and helium. As generations of stars lived and died,
supernovae and stellar winds seeded the interstellar medium with heavier elements. Later
stars therefore formed from a richer mix of ingredients. Because planets assemble from the
same natal disk as their star, metallicity can shape what kinds of planets are built.

The connection is clearest for giant planets. The core-accretion model suggests that a solid
core must form quickly enough to begin capturing gas before the protoplanetary disk
dissipates. If a disk is rich in solids—ices, silicates, and metals—cores can grow faster.
Observational surveys have long found that gas giants are more common around metal-rich
stars, consistent with this picture. Yet the story for smaller planets is subtler. Rocky
planets appear around a wide range of metallicities, implying that making a few Earth-mass
worlds does not demand an especially heavy-element-rich disk.

Even within rocky planets, composition can vary. The ratio of magnesium to silicon
influences mantle mineralogy; iron abundance affects core size and density; carbon abundance
can change what solids condense at high temperatures. A disk with a relatively high carbon-
to-oxygen ratio might favor carbides and graphite in its inner regions, potentially
producing “carbon-rich” rocky worlds with geologies unlike Earth’s. [A] Such planets are not
guaranteed, but the chemistry of condensation sets the menu from which planetesimals are
assembled.

Stellar metallicity also correlates with disk opacity and cooling. A disk full of dust
absorbs and re-emits radiation, altering its temperature profile. Temperature, in turn,
controls where volatile compounds condense, defining snow lines for water, CO2, and other
molecules. If the water snow line sits farther from the star, the region where icy
planetesimals form shifts, which can influence how much water is delivered inward by
migrating bodies. In one system, a close-in rocky planet might be dry; in another, formed
under different disk conditions, a similar orbit might host an ocean world.

These links, however, are probabilistic. Planets migrate; disks evolve; and later impacts
reshuffle material. A rocky planet’s final water inventory might owe more to a late
bombardment than to the disk’s initial metallicity. Moreover, measuring stellar abundances
is itself challenging. Spectroscopic lines can be blended, and surface abundances can be
altered over time by mixing or by the accretion of planets. [B] Astronomers therefore treat
metallicity as an informative clue, not as a deterministic blueprint.

The most exciting opportunity comes from combining stellar chemistry with exoplanet density
measurements and atmospheric data. If a planet’s mass and radius imply an unusually high
iron fraction, and its star shows corresponding iron enrichment, the pair can support a
coherent story. If they diverge, migration or selective accretion may be implicated. As
sample sizes grow, comparisons across hundreds of systems can test whether certain stellar
abundance patterns systematically predict certain planet types—dense super-Earths, water-
rich sub-Neptunes, or gas giants near snow lines.

In the end, stars are not only lamps but ingredient lists. [C] Their spectra encode the
elements from which their planets were built, even if the assembly process shuffles those
elements into surprising arrangements. [D] By reading metallicity and element ratios as part
of a planet-formation narrative, astronomers move closer to explaining why some systems
resemble our own and why others look alien in ways that chemistry can, at least partly,
anticipate.

If a disk’s composition is altered by its star’s chemistry, planet formation can inherit
those biases, producing systems that feel familiar yet subtly skewed.


Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, why are gas giants more common around metal-rich stars?
   A. Solid cores can form faster in disks rich in heavy elements, enabling gas capture before the disk dissipates
   B. Metal-rich stars emit less light, making gas giants easier to detect
   C. Metallicity prevents planetary migration entirely
   D. Gas giants form only by gravitational lensing of starlight

2. [Vocabulary] The word “opacity” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. how strongly the disk blocks or absorbs radiation
   B. how quickly a planet orbits its star
   C. the sharpness of a telescope’s image
   D. the thickness of an obsidian hydration rim

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In other words, abundance ratios can alter planetary interiors even when total ‘metallicity’ is similar.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why metallicity is described as a “clue” rather than a “blueprint”?
   A. Because migration, impacts, and measurement limits can decouple a planet’s final properties from initial disk chemistry
   B. Because metallicity has no relationship to any planet properties
   C. Because stars change their spectra randomly each day
   D. Because element ratios cannot be measured at all

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as complications in linking stars to planets EXCEPT:
   A. planets migrating and disks evolving
   B. late impacts reshuffling material
   C. spectral line blending affecting abundance measurements
   D. sea urchins overgrazing kelp forests

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss snow lines and disk temperature profiles?
   A. To show how dust and chemistry can shift where volatiles condense, affecting water delivery and planet types
   B. To argue that temperature has no effect on planet formation
   C. To claim that snow lines exist only on Earth
   D. To explain why stars are called ‘metal-rich’ historically

7. [Reference] In the passage, “they diverge” refers to cases where:
   A. planet composition indicators and stellar abundance patterns do not match, suggesting migration or selective accretion
   B. gas giants always orbit closer than rocky planets
   C. snow lines and oceans are the same thing
   D. supernovae occur inside protoplanetary disks

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It defines metallicity, links it to giant-planet frequency, extends the idea to rocky composition and disk thermodynamics, then explains why outcomes are probabilistic and how combined measurements can test patterns
   B. It lists star names by constellation
   C. It argues only for carbon planets and ignores other chemistry
   D. It focuses exclusively on telescope design

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates “stars are ingredient lists”?
   A. A star’s spectrum reveals element abundances that supply the raw materials for its planets
   B. Stars physically contain complete planets inside them
   C. Ingredient lists are written on planets, not stars
   D. Only metal-poor stars can form rocky planets

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Stellar metallicity perfectly determines each planet’s exact composition and orbit.
   B. The passage explains stellar metallicity as a record of heavy-element abundance, links high metallicity to more frequent gas giants via faster core growth, shows how element ratios and disk temperature influence rocky planet interiors and water delivery, and emphasizes that migration and impacts make the star–planet link probabilistic but testable with growing datasets.
   C. Rocky planets form only around metal-rich stars, while gas giants form only around metal-poor stars.
   D. Snow lines are irrelevant to any aspect of planet formation.
