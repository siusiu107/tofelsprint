Passage 0983: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 717)

When catalysts are benchmarked across labs, the central disagreement can be stated more
precisely: researchers have treated structure-sensitive activity as the decisive sign of
heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Admittedly, temperature-programmed desorption
can make the pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn,
forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on facet dependence, it is difficult to
deny that many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces as a
single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized structure-sensitive activity
as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same signature survives when
protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under replication. The passage argues
that this shift mattered for how evidence from electrochemical interfaces was generalized
because local conditions can change which processes generate structure-sensitive activity.
In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Though the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how facet dependence
can shift baselines, altering whether structure-sensitive activity is even comparable across
cases, which helps explain why means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation.
If facet dependence is changed while the nominal driver remains constant, one should expect
different outcomes when conditions are perturbed.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. [A] The discussion treats exceptions as informative,
not as errors to be discarded. If one wishes to move from description to explanation holds,
then the same observation—structure-sensitive activity—must be paired with tests that change
the conditions under which it appears. [B] This detail becomes important later, when
assumptions are tested. Whereas popular summaries treat structure-sensitive activity as an
endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts. [C] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured
with what is inferred. [D] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a
decisive test. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only through analysts began combining temperature-programmed desorption with cross-site
comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum
surfaces stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
the goal was to break degeneracies in which structure-sensitive activity could be explained
in more than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like facet dependence often
co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable.

Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet dependence was the field
forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which temperature-programmed desorption constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is
precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. a
single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic
conversion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record
can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even though the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which structure-sensitive activity is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions
rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that boundary conditions is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents rate enhancement from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control facet dependence
   B. Because facet dependence co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. Since rate enhancement is observed in laboratory single-crystal studies, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because rate enhancement appears, the mechanism must be unique, so facet dependence can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because poisoning by CO uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that adsorbate coverage effects is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using surface microscopy are unnecessary.
   B. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that poisoning by CO is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how adsorbate coverage effects can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from automotive catalytic converters. Finally, it maintains that tests combining surface microscopy with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   C. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like adsorbate coverage effects make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting surface microscopy as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats surface microscopy as a historical curiosity and does not discuss poisoning by CO or adsorbate coverage effects. It ends without any methodological implication.

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing theories?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where DFT surface modeling constrains adsorbate coverage effects
   B. The author argues that DFT surface modeling should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'surface-mediated catalysis on Pt' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   D. The passage treats selectivity shifts as a confounder and adsorbate coverage effects as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. structure-sensitive activity
