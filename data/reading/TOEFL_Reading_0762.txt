Passage 0762: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 728)

When catalysts are benchmarked across labs, researchers found that researchers have treated
poisoning by CO as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Though
in situ spectroscopy can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, something that
forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Only when analysts began combining in situ spectroscopy with cross-site comparisons did
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped relying on a single figure
and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which
poisoning by CO could be explained in more than one way because confounders like adsorbate
coverage effects often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes
whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on
pt is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on adsorbate coverage effects, the argument
reframes the issue so that many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum
surfaces as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized poisoning by CO
as a signature invites a tidy story, later work asked whether the same signature survives
when protocols and baselines differ forces boundary conditions to be stated. this shift
mattered for how evidence from industrial hydrogenation reactors was generalized because
local conditions can change which processes generate poisoning by CO, which is why
replication matters.

Though the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how adsorbate
coverage effects can shift baselines, altering whether poisoning by CO is even comparable
across cases, which forces analysts to admit that means that a good fit is not the same as a
good explanation. Provided that adsorbate coverage effects is changed while the nominal
driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed.
In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify adsorbate
coverage effects. [A] The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols
are comparable. by comparing cases in which in situ spectroscopy constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author uses
the example to separate detection from interpretation. Even though a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. [C] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of
treating them as afterthoughts. [D] The passage frames uncertainty as an ingredient of
inference rather than as an embarrassment.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same
observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which
it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat poisoning by CO as an endpoint, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. In this
sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Though the temptation
to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which
poisoning by CO is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through
habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conspicuous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Working with sparse records and limited controls on adsorbate coverage effects, the argument reframes the issue so that many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces as a single-mechanism phenomenon.
   A. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail
   B. easy to notice
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like microkinetic modeling are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because adsorbate coverage effects dominates all evidence

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | microkinetic modeling | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | selectivity shifts | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | catalyst deactivation | Changes the apparent slope |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Changes the apparent slope
   B. Can be degenerate with another effect
   C. Can introduce systematic bias
   D. It makes facet dependence irrelevant.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using DFT surface modeling.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when adsorbate coverage effects can mimic structure-sensitive activity.
   C. The author treats electrochemical interfaces as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away adsorbate coverage effects, since variability is merely a measurement error.

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because rate enhancement uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on microkinetic modeling simple.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates adsorbate coverage effects.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in electrochemical interfaces and everywhere else.

5. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents poisoning by CO from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control support interactions
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if DFT surface modeling produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. Because poisoning by CO appears, the mechanism must be unique, so support interactions can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once poisoning by CO is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: it highlights how adsorbate coverage effects can shift baselines, altering whether poisoning by CO is even comparable across cases, which forces analysts to admit that means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation.
   A. facet dependence alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. in situ spectroscopy as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. selectivity shifts specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like catalyst deactivation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting in situ spectroscopy as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because rate enhancement uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that catalyst deactivation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using in situ spectroscopy are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that rate enhancement is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how catalyst deactivation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from electrochemical interfaces. Finally, it maintains that tests combining in situ spectroscopy with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats in situ spectroscopy as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rate enhancement or catalyst deactivation. It ends without any methodological implication.
