Passage 0081: Tree Rings, the Great Drought, and the Reorganization of Ancestral Pueblo Communities (Archaeology/Climate)
=========================================================================================================================
(Word count: 618)

Tree rings are, in one sense, modest: a yearly layer of wood, slightly thicker in wet years
and slightly thinner in dry ones. Yet when ring sequences are stacked across many trees and
anchored to calendar years, they become a chronological instrument that can reconstruct past
climates at annual resolution. In the American Southwest, where rainfall variability is high
and long-term droughts can be socially decisive, dendrochronology has been used to ask an
archaeological question with ecological teeth: how did water scarcity shape the rise and
reorganization of Ancestral Pueblo communities?

Pinyon pines and Douglas firs in the region respond to moisture stress in measurable ways.
In years of limited soil moisture, growth is constrained, producing narrow rings; in years
of ample precipitation, rings expand. Because living trees overlap in time with dead beams
preserved in ancient structures, archaeologists can extend ring chronologies far into the
past by matching ring-width patterns like barcodes. [A] Once beams from multiple sites are
cross-dated, the resulting “master chronology” becomes both a calendar and a rainfall proxy.

The late thirteenth century provides a striking case. Many settlements in the Four Corners
region show evidence of population movement and architectural change during this period, and
tree-ring records indicate a sequence of dry years—often called the Great Drought—between
roughly 1276 and 1299. Narrow-ring intervals are not, by themselves, a direct record of
empty villages, because people can buffer scarcity through storage, trade, or shifting
crops. However, when drought persists for decades, the buffer thins. Maize yields decline as
planting windows shrink; springs run lower; and soils, stressed by repeated cultivation,
recover more slowly. [B] Under such prolonged stress, even well-designed water-harvesting
systems can become insufficient.

Archaeological signatures hint at the social consequences. Some mesa-top villages show signs
of aggregation, suggesting that families clustered for defense or for cooperative labor,
while other areas show abandonment and later reoccupation. In Chaco Canyon centuries
earlier, large “great houses” had concentrated labor and ritual authority; later, the Mesa
Verde region developed dense cliff dwellings. Interpreting these shifts requires caution,
because conflict, ideology, and trade routes can all reorganize settlement independent of
rainfall. Still, when migration corridors align with drought timing, climate becomes a
credible pressure that interacts with social choices rather than replacing them.

Not all droughts produce the same outcomes. Short droughts can be endured, and they can even
stimulate innovation, such as more flexible field placement or diversified crops.
Conversely, wet intervals can allow expansion that later becomes brittle if it relies on
consistently high yields. The archaeological record therefore looks less like a simple
“drought causes collapse” formula and more like a series of constrained decisions. People
moved not because a ring-width graph commanded them, but because, as harvests failed
repeatedly, the cost of staying rose while the imagined benefits of leaving increased.

The value of tree rings in this debate lies in their specificity. A pottery style can be
dated by broad phases, yet rings can identify whether building beams were cut in a
particular year, and whether that year fell in a run of dry seasons. When beams at a site
cluster in a narrow window and then disappear, the pattern suggests a pulse of construction
followed by cessation. [C] Combined with evidence of storage rooms, irrigation features, and
trade goods, dendrochronology allows archaeologists to ask whether communities expanded
during wet decades and contracted during dry ones, or whether they reorganized in more
complex ways.

In the end, the Great Drought is neither the sole villain nor an irrelevant background. [D]
It is better understood as a long-duration stressor that magnified existing tensions,
rewarded certain strategies, and made other strategies untenable, thereby nudging societies
into new geographies and new social arrangements.

Questions
---------
1. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the method can tie construction timbers to specific years, it can connect human activity to particular climate sequences.
   A. [D]
   B. [A]
   C. [B]
   D. [C]


2. [Vocabulary] The word “buffer” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. to carve stone beams for architecture
   B. to copy ring patterns without overlap
   C. to measure rainfall with a laboratory instrument
   D. to reduce the impact of hardship by using reserves


3. [Factual] According to the passage, what makes dendrochronology especially useful for Southwest archaeology?
   A. It can provide annual dating and climate signals by cross-dating beams with living-tree records.
   B. It must provide annual dating and climate signals by cross-dating beams with living-tree records. This outcome would hold even if pinyon stays constant.
   C. It can solely provide annual dating and climate signals by cross-dating beams with living-tree records. This would require dendrochronology to be the limiting factor.
   D. It can provide annual dating and climate signals by cross-dating beams with living-tree records by tying the effect to rings.


4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why the author warns against a simple “drought causes collapse” interpretation?
   A. Because social factors such as conflict, ideology, and trade can shape outcomes, and short acts as a constraint rather than a single cause. This would require verde to be the limiting factor.
   B. Because social factors such as conflict, ideology, and trade must shape outcomes, and drought acts as a constraint rather than a single cause. This outcome would hold even if long-duration stays constant.
   C. even though social factors such as conflict, ideology, and trade can shape outcomes, and drought acts as a constraint rather than a single cause. This would occur only when dendrochronology dominates.
   D. Because social factors such as conflict, ideology, and trade can shape outcomes, and drought acts as a constraint rather than a single cause.


5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as ways people might mitigate short-term scarcity EXCEPT:
