Passage 0081: Tree Rings, the Great Drought, and the Reorganization of Ancestral Pueblo Communities (Archaeology/Climate)
=========================================================================================================================
(Word count: 618)

Tree rings are, in one sense, modest: a yearly layer of wood, slightly thicker in wet years
and slightly thinner in dry ones. Yet when ring sequences are stacked across many trees and
anchored to calendar years, they become a chronological instrument that can reconstruct past
climates at annual resolution. In the American Southwest, where rainfall variability is high
and long-term droughts can be socially decisive, dendrochronology has been used to ask an
archaeological question with ecological teeth: how did water scarcity shape the rise and
reorganization of Ancestral Pueblo communities?

Pinyon pines and Douglas firs in the region respond to moisture stress in measurable ways.
In years of limited soil moisture, growth is constrained, producing narrow rings; in years
of ample precipitation, rings expand. Because living trees overlap in time with dead beams
preserved in ancient structures, archaeologists can extend ring chronologies far into the
past by matching ring-width patterns like barcodes. [A] Once beams from multiple sites are
cross-dated, the resulting “master chronology” becomes both a calendar and a rainfall proxy.

The late thirteenth century provides a striking case. Many settlements in the Four Corners
region show evidence of population movement and architectural change during this period, and
tree-ring records indicate a sequence of dry years—often called the Great Drought—between
roughly 1276 and 1299. Narrow-ring intervals are not, by themselves, a direct record of
empty villages, because people can buffer scarcity through storage, trade, or shifting
crops. However, when drought persists for decades, the buffer thins. Maize yields decline as
planting windows shrink; springs run lower; and soils, stressed by repeated cultivation,
recover more slowly. [B] Under such prolonged stress, even well-designed water-harvesting
systems can become insufficient.

Archaeological signatures hint at the social consequences. Some mesa-top villages show signs
of aggregation, suggesting that families clustered for defense or for cooperative labor,
while other areas show abandonment and later reoccupation. In Chaco Canyon centuries
earlier, large “great houses” had concentrated labor and ritual authority; later, the Mesa
Verde region developed dense cliff dwellings. Interpreting these shifts requires caution,
because conflict, ideology, and trade routes can all reorganize settlement independent of
rainfall. Still, when migration corridors align with drought timing, climate becomes a
credible pressure that interacts with social choices rather than replacing them.

Not all droughts produce the same outcomes. Short droughts can be endured, and they can even
stimulate innovation, such as more flexible field placement or diversified crops.
Conversely, wet intervals can allow expansion that later becomes brittle if it relies on
consistently high yields. The archaeological record therefore looks less like a simple
“drought causes collapse” formula and more like a series of constrained decisions. People
moved not because a ring-width graph commanded them, but because, as harvests failed
repeatedly, the cost of staying rose while the imagined benefits of leaving increased.

The value of tree rings in this debate lies in their specificity. A pottery style can be
dated by broad phases, yet rings can identify whether building beams were cut in a
particular year, and whether that year fell in a run of dry seasons. When beams at a site
cluster in a narrow window and then disappear, the pattern suggests a pulse of construction
followed by cessation. [C] Combined with evidence of storage rooms, irrigation features, and
trade goods, dendrochronology allows archaeologists to ask whether communities expanded
during wet decades and contracted during dry ones, or whether they reorganized in more
complex ways.

In the end, the Great Drought is neither the sole villain nor an irrelevant background. [D]
It is better understood as a long-duration stressor that magnified existing tensions,
rewarded certain strategies, and made other strategies untenable, thereby nudging societies
into new geographies and new social arrangements.


Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the method can tie construction timbers to specific years, it can connect human activity to particular climate sequences.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Vocabulary] The word “buffer” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. to reduce the impact of hardship by using reserves or alternative strategies
   B. to measure rainfall with a laboratory instrument
   C. to carve stone beams for architecture
   D. to copy ring patterns without overlap

3. [Factual] According to the passage, what makes dendrochronology especially useful for Southwest archaeology?
   A. It can provide annual dating and climate signals by cross-dating beams with living-tree records
   B. It dates pottery styles more precisely than any other method
   C. It measures groundwater chemistry directly in springs
   D. It eliminates the need to study migration or trade

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why the author warns against a simple “drought causes collapse” interpretation?
   A. Because social factors such as conflict, ideology, and trade can shape outcomes, and drought acts as a constraint rather than a single cause
   B. Because droughts never affect agriculture in drylands
   C. Because tree rings cannot be matched across trees
   D. Because populations always remain in place during scarcity

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as ways people might mitigate short-term scarcity EXCEPT:
   A. storage of resources
   B. trade or exchange networks
   C. shifting crops or field placement
   D. electrically heating catalysts to warm exhaust

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author describe ring-width matching “like barcodes”?
   A. To clarify how distinctive growth patterns allow archaeologists to cross-date wood samples across time
   B. To suggest that ancient people used barcodes for trade
   C. To argue that ring widths are meaningless without conflict evidence
   D. To claim that all trees grow at identical rates each year

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the buffer thins” refers to:
   A. the diminishing capacity of communities to absorb prolonged drought through reserves and adaptations
   B. the physical thinning of canyon walls due to erosion
   C. the shrinking of tree bark in winter
   D. a reduction in trade goods caused by mining bans

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces dendrochronology, explains how chronologies are built, then connects a specific drought interval to archaeological patterns while emphasizing interaction between climate and social decisions
   B. It lists Southwestern tree species without discussing archaeology
   C. It argues that climate is irrelevant to human settlement
   D. It describes only irrigation technology and omits dating methods

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the author’s view of the Great Drought’s role?
   A. It functioned as a long-lasting stress that intensified existing pressures and influenced choices rather than dictating a single inevitable outcome
   B. It single-handedly destroyed every settlement and ended farming permanently
   C. It was a brief event that left no trace in rings
   D. It mattered only for tree biology and not for people

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Tree rings can date only living trees and therefore cannot inform archaeology.
   B. The passage explains how dendrochronology builds annual chronologies by matching ring patterns across living trees and preserved beams, and it uses the late-thirteenth-century Southwest drought to show how prolonged moisture stress likely constrained Ancestral Pueblo agriculture and settlement choices, while cautioning that migration and reorganization reflected interactions between climate pressures and social factors.
   C. The Great Drought is presented as irrelevant because trade eliminated all food risk.
   D. Architectural change is attributed solely to new stone tools rather than climate or social dynamics.
