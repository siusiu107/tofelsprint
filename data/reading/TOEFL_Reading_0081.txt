Passage 0081: Tree Rings, the Great Drought, and the Reorganization of Ancestral Pueblo Communities (Archaeology/Climate)
=========================================================================================================================
(Word count: 618)

Tree rings are, in one sense, modest: a yearly layer of wood, slightly thicker in wet years
and slightly thinner in dry ones. Yet when ring sequences are stacked across many trees and
anchored to calendar years, they become a chronological instrument that can reconstruct past
climates at annual resolution. In the American Southwest, where rainfall variability is high
and long-term droughts can be socially decisive, dendrochronology has been used to ask an
archaeological question with ecological teeth: how did water scarcity shape the rise and
reorganization of Ancestral Pueblo communities?

Pinyon pines and Douglas firs in the region respond to moisture stress in measurable ways.
In years of limited soil moisture, growth is constrained, producing narrow rings; in years
of ample precipitation, rings expand. Because living trees overlap in time with dead beams
preserved in ancient structures, archaeologists can extend ring chronologies far into the
past by matching ring-width patterns like barcodes. [A] Once beams from multiple sites are
cross-dated, the resulting “master chronology” becomes both a calendar and a rainfall proxy.

The late thirteenth century provides a striking case. Many settlements in the Four Corners
region show evidence of population movement and architectural change during this period, and
tree-ring records indicate a sequence of dry years—often called the Great Drought—between
roughly 1276 and 1299. Narrow-ring intervals are not, by themselves, a direct record of
empty villages, because people can buffer scarcity through storage, trade, or shifting
crops. However, when drought persists for decades, the buffer thins. Maize yields decline as
planting windows shrink; springs run lower; and soils, stressed by repeated cultivation,
recover more slowly. [B] Under such prolonged stress, even well-designed water-harvesting
systems can become insufficient.

Archaeological signatures hint at the social consequences. Some mesa-top villages show signs
of aggregation, suggesting that families clustered for defense or for cooperative labor,
while other areas show abandonment and later reoccupation. In Chaco Canyon centuries
earlier, large “great houses” had concentrated labor and ritual authority; later, the Mesa
Verde region developed dense cliff dwellings. Interpreting these shifts requires caution,
because conflict, ideology, and trade routes can all reorganize settlement independent of
rainfall. Still, when migration corridors align with drought timing, climate becomes a
credible pressure that interacts with social choices rather than replacing them.

Not all droughts produce the same outcomes. Short droughts can be endured, and they can even
stimulate innovation, such as more flexible field placement or diversified crops.
Conversely, wet intervals can allow expansion that later becomes brittle if it relies on
consistently high yields. The archaeological record therefore looks less like a simple
“drought causes collapse” formula and more like a series of constrained decisions. People
moved not because a ring-width graph commanded them, but because, as harvests failed
repeatedly, the cost of staying rose while the imagined benefits of leaving increased.

The value of tree rings in this debate lies in their specificity. A pottery style can be
dated by broad phases, yet rings can identify whether building beams were cut in a
particular year, and whether that year fell in a run of dry seasons. When beams at a site
cluster in a narrow window and then disappear, the pattern suggests a pulse of construction
followed by cessation. [C] Combined with evidence of storage rooms, irrigation features, and
trade goods, dendrochronology allows archaeologists to ask whether communities expanded
during wet decades and contracted during dry ones, or whether they reorganized in more
complex ways.

In the end, the Great Drought is neither the sole villain nor an irrelevant background. [D]
It is better understood as a long-duration stressor that magnified existing tensions,
rewarded certain strategies, and made other strategies untenable, thereby nudging societies
into new geographies and new social arrangements.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In the American Southwest, where rainfall variability is high and long-term droughts can be socially decisive, dendrochronology has been used to ask an archaeological question with ecological teeth: how did water scarcity shape the rise and reorganization of Ancestral Pueblo communities?
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across beams
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of beams
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to years and drought

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys rings but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed drought first, with years serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats beams as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, in the examples provided.
   B. The passage presents drought as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once years is observed, competing explanations for rings collapse. It treats beams as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage explains rings by linking years to drought, and it shows why beams changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage concedes that years is often incomplete and concludes that rings cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since beams overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of drought with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how rings should change if beams is altered, instead of assuming that years has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to drought must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in beams, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of years is enough to validate drought for rings.
   C. The passage implies that beams mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes years effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of drought no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain rings, especially regarding rings, especially regarding rings, for the phenomenon at issue.
   D. The passage treats years primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over drought are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about rings are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of rings as a factor influencing years
   B. discussion of radiocarbon reservoir effects as a factor influencing years
   C. discussion of drought as a factor influencing years, especially regarding beams.
   D. discussion of beams as a factor influencing years

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: In the American Southwest, where rainfall variability is high and long-term droughts can be socially decisive, dendrochronology has been used to ask an archaeological question with ecological teeth: how did water scarcity shape the rise and reorganization of Ancestral Pueblo communities?
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   B. In the American Southwest. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. In the American Southwest. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once years fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and beams can be ignored without changing conclusions about rings.
   B. Because years directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding rings.
   C. Because the presence of drought guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in beams are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because comparability prevents drought from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold beams constant while examining years.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | years | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | beams | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It proves drought is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that rings should be read alongside beams, because years alone does not settle what drought means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Tree rings are, in one sense, modest: a yearly layer of wood, slightly thicker in wet years and slightly thinner in dry ones.
   A. the preceding claim that beams alone explains the outcome of rings
   B. the preceding claim that years is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   C. the preceding claim about how years is interpreted in relation to drought
   D. the preceding claim that rings functions as a direct measurement of drought

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of years and drought should be abandoned altogether.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses drought, so debate over years is unnecessary noise, especially regarding whether, especially regarding years.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of years lead to different conclusions about rings.
   D. to show that the term rings belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
