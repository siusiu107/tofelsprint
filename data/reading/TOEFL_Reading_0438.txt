Passage 0438: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 771)

When memory is tested repeatedly, researchers have treated increased liking for chosen
options as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
Though longitudinal attitude surveys can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage
argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather
than rely on familiar narratives. Only after analysts began combining longitudinal attitude
surveys with cross-site comparisons did claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which increased
liking for chosen options could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
public versus private commitment often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which
helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, post-
choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. Working with sparse records and limited controls on public versus private commitment,
the key question becomes whether many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized
increased liking for chosen options as a signature is easy to measure, later work asked
whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ is harder to
interpret without assumptions. this shift mattered for how evidence from cross-national
survey samples was generalized because local conditions can change which processes generate
increased liking for chosen options. The point is not X but methodological humility; in that
framing, the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A]
The author suggests that the same evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ.
If one wishes to move from description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then
the same observation—increased liking for chosen options—must be paired with tests that
change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The author shifts from narrative to
diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. Whereas popular summaries treat
increased liking for chosen options as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as
a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. [C] This
becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. [D] The passage signals
that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. Using longitudinal attitude surveys under
stable conditions, the key question becomes whether one frequently cited case from cross-
national survey samples appeared to support the direct-readout view. Despite the fact that
the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small
shifts in public versus private commitment altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic
increased liking for chosen options. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which
illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. In
this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label. Hardly had analysts began combining longitudinal attitude
surveys with cross-site comparisons occurred when claims about cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which
increased liking for chosen options could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like public versus private commitment often co-vary with the driver. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. Rarely has it
been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical,
at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify public versus private
commitment. by comparing cases in which longitudinal attitude surveys constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces
analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. Even though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, self-
justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. shifted confidence judgments
   B. the price of coal in 1700
   C. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   D. longitudinal attitude surveys

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'post-choice attitude change' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   B. The discussion suggests that public versus private commitment is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The passage implies that cross-national survey samples is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains public versus private commitment

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which increased liking for chosen options could be explained in more than one way because confounders like public versus private commitment often co-vary with the driver.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates public versus private commitment.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on meta-analytic synthesis simple.

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. self-concept threat alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. implicit association tests as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. increased liking for chosen options specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **idiosyncratic** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify public versus private commitment.
   A. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like implicit association tests are needed
   C. peculiar to one case
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats implicit association tests as a historical curiosity and does not discuss devaluation of rejected alternatives or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using implicit association tests are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting implicit association tests as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that devaluation of rejected alternatives is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining implicit association tests with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.

7. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when self-concept threat can mimic devaluation of rejected alternatives.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using meta-analytic synthesis.
   C. The passage suggests that devaluation of rejected alternatives is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving meta-analytic synthesis.

8. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | behavioral priming designs | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | selective memory for supporting evidence | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | public versus private commitment | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It makes measurement reactivity irrelevant.
   B. May not generalize across contexts
   C. It proves shifted confidence judgments is unique.
   D. Can be degenerate with another effect

9. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control self-concept threat
   B. Because self-concept threat co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. Since selective memory for supporting evidence is observed in workplace decision settings, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because selective memory for supporting evidence appears, the mechanism must be unique, so self-concept threat can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

10. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The passage underscores that transparency about priors can be more informative than presenting one visually impressive fit.
   A. [A]
