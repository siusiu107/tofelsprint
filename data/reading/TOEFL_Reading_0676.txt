Passage 0676: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 772)

In replication efforts, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated devaluation of
rejected alternatives as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. Even though behavioral priming designs can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Not until the field adopted
tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat was it clear that the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which behavioral
priming designs constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out
of sample, a move that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. Granted that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, post-
choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. Only after analysts began combining behavioral priming designs with cross-site
comparisons did claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which devaluation of rejected alternatives could be explained in more
than one way because confounders like self-concept threat often co-vary with the driver. as
the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. Using behavioral priming designs under stable conditions, the key question
becomes whether one frequently cited case from workplace decision settings appeared to
support the direct-readout view. the original fit looked visually decisive; still, later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in self-concept threat altered the baseline
enough to mute or mimic devaluation of rejected alternatives. the passage treats this
episode as diagnostic; this, in turn, illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted. Working with sparse records and limited controls on
self-concept threat, the author treats the complication as diagnostic, so many early studies
framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization as a single-mechanism
phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized devaluation of rejected alternatives as a
signature is easy to measure, later work asked whether the same signature survives when
protocols and baselines differ is harder to interpret without assumptions. this shift
mattered for how evidence from workplace decision settings was generalized because local
conditions can change which processes generate devaluation of rejected alternatives. In this
sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label. If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and
therefore the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If
one wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the same
observation—devaluation of rejected alternatives—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat devaluation of rejected
alternatives as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication.
Using behavioral priming designs under stable conditions, it is difficult to deny that one
frequently cited case from workplace decision settings appeared to support the direct-
readout view. [A] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence. Even
if the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small
shifts in self-concept threat altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic devaluation of
rejected alternatives. [B] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames
it as conditional. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which illustrates why
boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. [C] The author
uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. [D]
This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline. In this sense,
self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label. In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most
informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.
by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. measurement reactivity alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. increased liking for chosen options specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. meta-analytic synthesis as a device rather than as an analytic approach

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | implicit association tests | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | selective memory for supporting evidence | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | measurement reactivity | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It makes measurement reactivity irrelevant.
   B. It proves selective memory for supporting evidence is unique.
   C. It replaces behavioral priming designs with intuition.
   D. May be muted by other processes

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates cultural norms about consistency.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in workplace decision settings and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on choice-induced preference paradigms simple.

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The passage treats selective memory for supporting evidence as a confounder and self-concept threat as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The passage implies that workplace decision settings is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author argues that implicit association tests should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains self-concept threat

5. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In short, the passage treats methodological humility as a strength, not as an admission of ignorance.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats implicit association tests as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting implicit association tests as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining implicit association tests with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using implicit association tests are unnecessary.

7. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats workplace decision settings as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic increased liking for chosen options.
   C. The passage suggests that increased liking for chosen options is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving meta-analytic synthesis.

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents increased liking for chosen options from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity
   B. The passage implies that longitudinal attitude surveys directly measures causes, meaning confounding from measurement reactivity is impossible.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if longitudinal attitude surveys produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. Since increased liking for chosen options is observed in workplace decision settings, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. meta-analytic synthesis
   B. a list of Olympic medal counts
   C. shifted confidence judgments
   D. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conspicuous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the goal was to break degeneracies in which devaluation of rejected alternatives could be explained in more than one way because confounders like self-concept threat often co-vary with the driver.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because measurement reactivity dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like meta-analytic synthesis are needed
   C. easy to notice
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
