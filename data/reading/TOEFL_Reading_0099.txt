Passage 0099: Polynesian Wayfinding and a Navigation System Without Instruments (Anthropology)
==============================================================================================
(Word count: 607)

For centuries, Polynesian navigators crossed vast stretches of the Pacific without
compasses, sextants, or written maps. To outsiders, such voyages once seemed implausible or
accidental, which fed myths that islands were settled by drifting canoes. Ethnographic work
and the revitalization of traditional voyaging have shown a different reality: wayfinding is
an expert system that combines observation, memory, and disciplined practice.

One component is the star compass. Navigators learn the rising and setting points of key
stars along the horizon and associate those points with directional houses. By steering
toward a star as it rises or sets, and then switching as it climbs or disappears, they
maintain a course through the night. The system is not a single star but a sequence. [A]
Because the sky changes with season and latitude, navigators also learn how the star field
shifts, adjusting their mental compass accordingly.

During the day, other cues take over. Swell patterns—the long, rolling waves generated by
distant winds—can persist for days and provide directional information even when local winds
change. Experienced navigators feel these swells through canoe motion and infer their
direction. Cloud forms can reveal islands indirectly: stationary cloud piles may form above
land, and certain cloud colors can reflect shallow lagoons. Birds, too, matter, especially
species that forage far but return to land at night. By observing their flight paths at dawn
or dusk, navigators can estimate land direction within a reachable range. [B] None of these
cues is infallible, yet the system relies on redundancy: when cues converge, confidence
rises.

Wayfinding is also social. Knowledge is transmitted through apprenticeship, with novices
learning by watching, practicing, and being corrected. Stories encode routes and hazards,
and chants can function as mnemonic devices that preserve sequence. The canoe itself is a
technological partner: its design affects speed, stability, and how swells are felt. A
navigator who cannot read canoe motion is missing part of the sensory instrument.

The revival voyages of the twentieth century, such as those by the Polynesian Voyaging
Society, demonstrated that traditional methods could succeed on modern seas. Yet the purpose
was not only proof of technique. Revitalization became a cultural project, challenging
colonial narratives and strengthening identity through practiced knowledge. At the same
time, scholars debated how much of ancient navigation was continuous and how much had to be
reconstructed. [C] The debate itself revealed that technique and meaning were intertwined:
navigation was both a practical skill and a symbol of heritage.

Polynesian wayfinding therefore offers a lesson about expertise. [D] It shows how humans can
build reliable systems from attention, pattern recognition, and shared training, even when
no metal needle points north.

Small errors accumulate over ocean distances, which is why navigators relied on redundant
cues rather than a single star.

Wayfinding is therefore both a cognitive map and a social practice, transmitted through
story, apprenticeship, and ritualized repetition.

Questions
---------
1. [Sentence Insert] In which location would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: When cues disagree, navigators rely on the convergence of multiple signs rather than trusting one alone.
   A. [C]
   B. [B]
   C. [D]
   D. [A]


2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word “redundancy” is closest in meaning to:
   A. to reverse a decision completely
   B. having multiple overlapping cues so that failure of one does
   C. to store objects in a warehouse
   D. to confuse the reader with unrelated details


3. [Factual] According to the passage, which statement is supported?
   A. navigators wayfinding plays a central role in the process described, interacting with star compass rather than acting alone. This would occur only when swell dominates.
   B. Polynesian wayfinding plays a central role in the process described, interacting with star compass rather than acting alone. This would require without to be the limiting factor.
   C. Polynesian wayfinding plays a central role in the process described, interacting with star compass rather than acting alone. This would require birds to be the limiting factor.
   D. Polynesian wayfinding plays a central role in the process described, interacting with star compass rather than acting alone.


4. [Negative Factual] All of the following are discussed in the passage EXCEPT:
   A. how star compass modifies or mediates the central phenomenon.
   B. limitations or trade-offs involving swells in this discussion.
   C. a laboratory protocol for measuring nitrate in river water by titration.
   D. the role of Polynesian wayfinding in shaping outcomes in this discussion.


5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author emphasize redundancy among navigation cues?
   A. to show how multiple imperfect signs can solely combine into a reliable wayfinding system over long distances. This would occur only when redundant dominates.
   B. to show how multiple imperfect signs can combine into a reliable wayfinding revitalization over long distances. This would require technique to be the limiting factor.
   C. to show how multiple imperfect signs must combine into a reliable wayfinding system over long distances. This outcome would hold even if accumulate stays constant.
   D. to show how multiple imperfect signs can combine into a reliable wayfinding system over long distances.


6. [Inference] Which inference is most strongly supported by the passage?
   A. Changes in star compass can shift the consequences of Polynesian wayfinding, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same.
   B. Changes in star compass can solely shift the consequences of Polynesian wayfinding, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same. That would make accumulate the primary constraint.
   C. Changes in star compass can shift the consequences of apprenticeship wayfinding, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same. This would require birds to be the limiting factor.
   D. Changes in star compass must shift the consequences of Polynesian wayfinding, even when the underlying mechanism remains the same. This outcome would hold even if anthropology stays constant.


7. [Reference] In the passage, the phrase “the system” most nearly refers to:
