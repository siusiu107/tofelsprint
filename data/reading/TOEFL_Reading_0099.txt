Passage 0099: Polynesian Wayfinding and a Navigation System Without Instruments (Anthropology)
==============================================================================================
(Word count: 607)

For centuries, Polynesian navigators crossed vast stretches of the Pacific without
compasses, sextants, or written maps. To outsiders, such voyages once seemed implausible or
accidental, which fed myths that islands were settled by drifting canoes. Ethnographic work
and the revitalization of traditional voyaging have shown a different reality: wayfinding is
an expert system that combines observation, memory, and disciplined practice.

One component is the star compass. Navigators learn the rising and setting points of key
stars along the horizon and associate those points with directional houses. By steering
toward a star as it rises or sets, and then switching as it climbs or disappears, they
maintain a course through the night. The system is not a single star but a sequence. [A]
Because the sky changes with season and latitude, navigators also learn how the star field
shifts, adjusting their mental compass accordingly.

During the day, other cues take over. Swell patterns—the long, rolling waves generated by
distant winds—can persist for days and provide directional information even when local winds
change. Experienced navigators feel these swells through canoe motion and infer their
direction. Cloud forms can reveal islands indirectly: stationary cloud piles may form above
land, and certain cloud colors can reflect shallow lagoons. Birds, too, matter, especially
species that forage far but return to land at night. By observing their flight paths at dawn
or dusk, navigators can estimate land direction within a reachable range. [B] None of these
cues is infallible, yet the system relies on redundancy: when cues converge, confidence
rises.

Wayfinding is also social. Knowledge is transmitted through apprenticeship, with novices
learning by watching, practicing, and being corrected. Stories encode routes and hazards,
and chants can function as mnemonic devices that preserve sequence. The canoe itself is a
technological partner: its design affects speed, stability, and how swells are felt. A
navigator who cannot read canoe motion is missing part of the sensory instrument.

The revival voyages of the twentieth century, such as those by the Polynesian Voyaging
Society, demonstrated that traditional methods could succeed on modern seas. Yet the purpose
was not only proof of technique. Revitalization became a cultural project, challenging
colonial narratives and strengthening identity through practiced knowledge. At the same
time, scholars debated how much of ancient navigation was continuous and how much had to be
reconstructed. [C] The debate itself revealed that technique and meaning were intertwined:
navigation was both a practical skill and a symbol of heritage.

Polynesian wayfinding therefore offers a lesson about expertise. [D] It shows how humans can
build reliable systems from attention, pattern recognition, and shared training, even when
no metal needle points north.

Small errors accumulate over ocean distances, which is why navigators relied on redundant
cues rather than a single star.

Wayfinding is therefore both a cognitive map and a social practice, transmitted through
story, apprenticeship, and ritualized repetition.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Ethnographic work and the revitalization of traditional voyaging have shown a different reality: wayfinding is an expert system that combines observation, memory, and disciplined practice.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across practice
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to wayfinding and single
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of practice
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains navigators by linking wayfinding to single, and it shows why practice changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents single as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once wayfinding is observed, competing explanations for navigators collapse. It treats practice as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage concedes that wayfinding is often incomplete and concludes that navigators cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since practice overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of single with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, especially regarding single.
   D. The passage surveys navigators but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed single first, with wayfinding serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats practice as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that practice mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes wayfinding effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of single no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain navigators, for the phenomenon at issue.
   B. The passage treats wayfinding primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over single are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about navigators are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how navigators should change if practice is altered, instead of assuming that wayfinding has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to single must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in practice, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of wayfinding is enough to validate single for navigators, in the setting discussed, especially regarding wayfinding.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of stress corrosion cracking as a factor influencing wayfinding
   B. discussion of single as a factor influencing wayfinding
   C. discussion of navigators as a factor influencing wayfinding
   D. discussion of practice as a factor influencing wayfinding, especially regarding practice.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Ethnographic work and the revitalization of traditional voyaging have shown a different reality: wayfinding is an expert system that combines observation, memory, and disciplined practice.
   A. Ethnographic work and the revitalization of traditional voyaging have shown a different reality: wayfinding is an expert system that combines observation.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, given the evidence cited, especially regarding transmitted.
   C. Ethnographic work and the revitalization of traditional voyaging have shown a different reality: wayfinding is an expert system that combines observation.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, especially regarding navigators, especially regarding social.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once wayfinding fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and practice can be ignored without changing conclusions about navigators.
   B. Because the presence of single guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in practice are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because comparability prevents single from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold practice constant while examining wayfinding.
   D. Because wayfinding directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding navigators.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | wayfinding | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | practice | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It proves single is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that navigators should be read alongside practice, because wayfinding alone does not settle what single means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "these" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Experienced navigators feel these swells through canoe motion and infer their direction.
   A. the idea that Cloud forms can reveal islands indirectly: stationary cloud piles may form above land, and certain cloud colors can reflect shallow lagoons
   B. the idea that Swell patterns—the long, rolling waves generated by distant winds—can persist for days and provide directional information even when local winds change...
   C. the idea that Wayfinding is therefore both a cognitive map and a social practice, transmitted through story, apprenticeship, and ritualized repetition
   D. the idea that During the day, other cues take over, for the phenomenon at issue, for the phenomenon at issue, within the passage’s scope, given the evidence cited.
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of wayfinding lead to different conclusions about navigators.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses single, so debate over wayfinding is unnecessary noise, especially regarding transmitted.
   C. to show that the term navigators belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding wayfinding.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of wayfinding and single should be abandoned altogether.
