Passage 0074: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 719)

In surface-science experiments, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated poisoning
by CO as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Although DFT
surface modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, a move that forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst
deactivation. by comparing cases in which DFT surface modeling constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still,
the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify catalyst deactivation,
does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which DFT surface modeling constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The passage signals that a tidy
fit may hide degenerate explanations. If one wishes to move from description to explanation,
a different prediction follows: then the same observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The passage returns to
this point to clarify what counts as evidence. Whereas popular summaries treat poisoning by
CO as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. [C] The
author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. [D] The author uses the detour to
show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. In this sense, platinum-
catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike electrochemical interfaces. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely because
catalyst deactivation shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. the author
therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating poisoning by CO as a
self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ.

Never before analysts began combining DFT surface modeling with cross-site comparisons was
it defensible to argue that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which poisoning by CO could be explained in more than one way
largely because confounders like catalyst deactivation often co-vary with the driver. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense,
metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as
a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even if the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which poisoning by CO is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats electrochemical interfaces as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using surface microscopy.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving surface microscopy.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when adsorbate coverage effects can mimic structure-sensitive activity.

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **persistent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: If one wishes to move from description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because adsorbate coverage effects dominates all evidence
   B. lasting
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like microkinetic modeling are needed
   D. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats in situ spectroscopy as a historical curiosity and does not discuss structure-sensitive activity or facet dependence. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that structure-sensitive activity is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how facet dependence can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from industrial hydrogenation reactors. Finally, it maintains that tests combining in situ spectroscopy with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   C. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because structure-sensitive activity uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that facet dependence is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using in situ spectroscopy are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like facet dependence make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting in situ spectroscopy as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The author emphasizes that a clean-looking curve can still encode hidden choices, especially when preprocessing is treated as neutral.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the length of the Nile in miles
   B. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   C. microkinetic modeling
   D. rate enhancement

6. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | surface microscopy | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | poisoning by CO | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Depends on modeling priors
   B. Shifts the baseline
   C. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices
   D. It replaces DFT surface modeling with intuition.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on surface microscopy simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in electrochemical interfaces and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because rate enhancement uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates facet dependence.

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where surface microscopy constrains adsorbate coverage effects
   B. The author argues that surface microscopy should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The discussion suggests that adsorbate coverage effects is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'Pt-active-site chemistry' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.

9. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once rate enhancement is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. it prevents rate enhancement from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control catalyst deactivation
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if microkinetic modeling produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. Because catalyst deactivation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

10. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: In surface-science experiments, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated poisoning by CO as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   A. microkinetic modeling as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. catalyst deactivation alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. selectivity shifts specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
