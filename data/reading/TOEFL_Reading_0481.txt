Passage 0481: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 762)

In twentieth-century urban histories, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated segregation and redlining signatures as the decisive sign of the
great migration and northern urban transformation. While it is true that oral history
synthesis can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence
is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less
about data collection than about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn, forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Only
through analysts began combining oral history synthesis with cross-site comparisons could
one reasonably claim that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which segregation and redlining signatures could be explained
in more than one way largely because confounders like push–pull dynamics often co-vary with
the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, african american internal migration is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Only through the field adopted tests that
manipulate or stratify push–pull dynamics could one reasonably claim that the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which oral
history synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive
out of sample, which helps explain why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value
of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. Using oral history
synthesis under stable conditions, the author treats the complication as diagnostic, so one
frequently cited case from Philadelphia appeared to support the direct-readout view. Though
the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small
shifts in push–pull dynamics altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic segregation and
redlining signatures. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which forces analysts
to admit that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. Working with sparse records and limited controls on push–pull dynamics, the
passage suggests many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban
transformation as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized
segregation and redlining signatures as a signature, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ. this shift mattered for how evidence
from Philadelphia was generalized because local conditions can change which processes
generate segregation and redlining signatures, which is why replication matters. In this
sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label. The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the
passage presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to
move from description to explanation to fail, then the same observation—segregation and
redlining signatures—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat segregation and redlining signatures as an endpoint
in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts in another. Only after analysts began combining oral history
synthesis with cross-site comparisons did claims about the great migration and northern
urban transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. [A] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is
inferred. the goal was to break degeneracies in which segregation and redlining signatures
could be explained in more than one way because confounders like push–pull dynamics often
co-vary with the driver. [B] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction
follows. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. [C] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as
conditional. [D] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid
overclaiming. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, it becomes plausible that the
passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces
competing assumptions into the open.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **convergent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, african american internal migration is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because racial violence and intimidation dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like oral history synthesis are needed
   C. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   D. coming together

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that political realignment patterns is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how push–pull dynamics can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Detroit. Finally, it maintains that tests combining census microdata analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   B. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like push–pull dynamics make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting census microdata analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because political realignment patterns uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that push–pull dynamics is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using census microdata analysis are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats census microdata analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss political realignment patterns or push–pull dynamics. It ends without any methodological implication.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. shifts in industrial labor demand
   B. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   C. housing record reconstruction
   D. the length of the Nile in miles

4. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using newspaper archive research.
   B. The author treats Chicago as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving newspaper archive research.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when housing covenants and policy constraints can mimic political realignment patterns.

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | housing record reconstruction | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | segregation and redlining signatures | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | wartime industry demand | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It replaces oral history synthesis with intuition.
   B. It proves shifts in industrial labor demand is unique.
   C. Shifts the baseline
   D. Can be degenerate with another effect

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the passage juxtapose two accounts of the phenomenon?
   A. The discussion suggests that wartime industry demand is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The passage implies that Harlem is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where housing record reconstruction constrains wartime industry demand
   D. The passage treats shifts in industrial labor demand as a confounder and wartime industry demand as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: Only through analysts began combining oral history synthesis with cross-site comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because political realignment patterns uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on labor market inference from wage series simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Detroit and everywhere else.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates wartime industry demand.

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that newspaper archive research directly measures causes, meaning confounding from racial violence and intimidation is impossible.
   B. it prevents segregation and redlining signatures from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control racial violence and intimidation
   C. Because racial violence and intimidation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once segregation and redlining signatures is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The author notes that a single dramatic example can mislead if it is treated as representative rather than as diagnostic.

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

10. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.
   A. push–pull dynamics alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. segregation and redlining signatures specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. oral history synthesis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
