Passage 0003: CRISPR-Cas as Bacterial Memory and Its Trade-offs (Biology)
=========================================================================
(Word count: 640)

Bacteria are often described as simple, yet their survival depends on recognizing threats in
a world crowded with viruses. A bacteriophage does not need to enter a cell with stealth; it
can attach, inject genetic material, and commandeer the host’s machinery within minutes. To
persist in such conditions, bacteria evolved defenses that range from surface receptors to
molecular “scissors.” Among the most striking is the CRISPR‑Cas system, which functions as
an adaptive memory: it records fragments of invader DNA and later uses that record to
destroy matching sequences.

At first glance, the idea that a bacterium “remembers” seems metaphorical, but CRISPR makes
memory literal by storing short DNA segments, called spacers, in a specialized array in the
bacterial genome. When a virus attacks, enzymes can capture a snippet of viral DNA and
insert it into the array, creating a genomic archive of past threats. That archive is then
transcribed into RNA guides that steer Cas proteins toward complementary sequences. The
moment a matching sequence is found, Cas cuts it, interrupting viral replication.

Two questions, however, complicate the tidy picture. First, how does the cell avoid
attacking its own genome, which also contains sequences resembling the stored spacers?
Second, why do some bacteria keep long CRISPR arrays while others carry only a few spacers?
One account emphasizes recognition tags: many CRISPR systems require a short motif adjacent
to the target, so the cell distinguishes foreign DNA from its own stored record. A second
account places the emphasis on cost. Maintaining a large archive demands resources, and
deploying Cas proteins can slow growth in virus‑free environments. [A] Under this view, a
large CRISPR repertoire is advantageous only when viral exposure is frequent enough to repay
the metabolic expense. [B] Thus, array length becomes an ecological trait, tuned to how
often a bacterium encounters phages, not merely to how sophisticated it can become. [C]

Evidence from microbial communities supports both accounts in different ways. In
environments where viral diversity is high—such as sewage and coastal waters—bacteria often
carry richer spacer collections, suggesting that repeated attack selects for broader memory.
Yet in laboratory competitions without phages, strains that overexpress Cas proteins can be
outcompeted by strains that downregulate the system, implying a growth penalty. Moreover,
even the recognition‑tag solution is not free of risk. Viruses can mutate the adjacent motif
or alter target sequences just enough to evade matching, forcing bacteria to continually
update their spacer archive.

This evolutionary tug‑of‑war can be seen as a race between two copying machines. The virus
copies itself rapidly, generating variation, while the bacterium copies and edits its spacer
library, hoping to keep pace. When phage pressure is intense, selection can favor bacteria
that acquire spacers quickly, even if that speed occasionally causes harmful targeting
errors. Conversely, when phages are rare, selection can favor bacteria that keep the system
quiet, accepting vulnerability in exchange for faster growth.

CRISPR’s importance is not limited to microbial survival. The same specificity that guides
Cas to viral DNA can be redirected by scientists, who provide an RNA guide of their
choosing. That redirection did not arise from a desire to engineer genomes; it emerged from
bacteria’s need to survive viral predation. [D] Understanding the system’s biological
constraints—how it discriminates self from non‑self, and why it is sometimes
silenced—therefore matters for biotechnology as much as it matters for ecology. The
mechanism is elegant, but it is also conditional, shaped by the costs and benefits of
defense in a changing viral landscape.

Viruses, meanwhile, have evolved countermeasures. Some carry “anti‑CRISPR” proteins that
bind Cas complexes and neutralize them, turning the bacterial archive into a silent library.
In communities where such countermeasures are common, bacteria may rely more on other
defenses, and CRISPR loci can shrink or even be lost.

Questions
---------
1. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author compare bacteria and viruses to “two copying machines”?
   A. To show that both organisms rely on replication and variation, creating an evolutionary race. That would make biology the primary constraint.
   B. To show that both organisms rely on replication and variation, creating an evolutionary race. This would occur only when countermeasures dominates.
   C. To show that both organisms rely on replication and variation, creating an evolutionary race by tying the effect to first.
   D. To show that both organisms rely on replication and variation, creating an evolutionary race.


2. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as challenges for CRISPR systems EXCEPT:

5. [Inference] What can be inferred about bacteria in environments with low phage pressure?
   A. They must benefit from reducing CRISPR activity because the defense cost may outweigh rare threats. This would require sequences to be the limiting factor.

   C. They may benefit from reducing CRISPR activity because the defense cost may outweigh rare threats by tying the effect to viruses.
   D. They may benefit from reducing CRISPR activity even though the defense cost may outweigh rare threats. This outcome would hold even if environments stays constant.


6. [Factual] According to the passage, how can many CRISPR systems distinguish foreign DNA from the cell’s own CRISPR array?

   A. rapid spacer acquisition in response to intense phage pressure.
   B. rapid spacer acquisition in response to intense phage pressure by tying the effect to recognition-tag. That would make non-self the primary constraint.

   C. How many spacers a bacterium maintains must depend on how often it encounters viruses in its environment. This would require anti-crispr to be the limiting factor.
