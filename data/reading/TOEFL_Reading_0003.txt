Passage 0003: CRISPR-Cas as Bacterial Memory and Its Trade-offs (Biology)
=========================================================================
(Word count: 640)

Bacteria are often described as simple, yet their survival depends on recognizing threats in
a world crowded with viruses. A bacteriophage does not need to enter a cell with stealth; it
can attach, inject genetic material, and commandeer the host’s machinery within minutes. To
persist in such conditions, bacteria evolved defenses that range from surface receptors to
molecular “scissors.” Among the most striking is the CRISPR‑Cas system, which functions as
an adaptive memory: it records fragments of invader DNA and later uses that record to
destroy matching sequences.

At first glance, the idea that a bacterium “remembers” seems metaphorical, but CRISPR makes
memory literal by storing short DNA segments, called spacers, in a specialized array in the
bacterial genome. When a virus attacks, enzymes can capture a snippet of viral DNA and
insert it into the array, creating a genomic archive of past threats. That archive is then
transcribed into RNA guides that steer Cas proteins toward complementary sequences. The
moment a matching sequence is found, Cas cuts it, interrupting viral replication.

Two questions, however, complicate the tidy picture. First, how does the cell avoid
attacking its own genome, which also contains sequences resembling the stored spacers?
Second, why do some bacteria keep long CRISPR arrays while others carry only a few spacers?
One account emphasizes recognition tags: many CRISPR systems require a short motif adjacent
to the target, so the cell distinguishes foreign DNA from its own stored record. A second
account places the emphasis on cost. Maintaining a large archive demands resources, and
deploying Cas proteins can slow growth in virus‑free environments. [A] Under this view, a
large CRISPR repertoire is advantageous only when viral exposure is frequent enough to repay
the metabolic expense. [B] Thus, array length becomes an ecological trait, tuned to how
often a bacterium encounters phages, not merely to how sophisticated it can become. [C]

Evidence from microbial communities supports both accounts in different ways. In
environments where viral diversity is high—such as sewage and coastal waters—bacteria often
carry richer spacer collections, suggesting that repeated attack selects for broader memory.
Yet in laboratory competitions without phages, strains that overexpress Cas proteins can be
outcompeted by strains that downregulate the system, implying a growth penalty. Moreover,
even the recognition‑tag solution is not free of risk. Viruses can mutate the adjacent motif
or alter target sequences just enough to evade matching, forcing bacteria to continually
update their spacer archive.

This evolutionary tug‑of‑war can be seen as a race between two copying machines. The virus
copies itself rapidly, generating variation, while the bacterium copies and edits its spacer
library, hoping to keep pace. When phage pressure is intense, selection can favor bacteria
that acquire spacers quickly, even if that speed occasionally causes harmful targeting
errors. Conversely, when phages are rare, selection can favor bacteria that keep the system
quiet, accepting vulnerability in exchange for faster growth.

CRISPR’s importance is not limited to microbial survival. The same specificity that guides
Cas to viral DNA can be redirected by scientists, who provide an RNA guide of their
choosing. That redirection did not arise from a desire to engineer genomes; it emerged from
bacteria’s need to survive viral predation. [D] Understanding the system’s biological
constraints—how it discriminates self from non‑self, and why it is sometimes
silenced—therefore matters for biotechnology as much as it matters for ecology. The
mechanism is elegant, but it is also conditional, shaped by the costs and benefits of
defense in a changing viral landscape.

Viruses, meanwhile, have evolved countermeasures. Some carry “anti‑CRISPR” proteins that
bind Cas complexes and neutralize them, turning the bacterial archive into a silent library.
In communities where such countermeasures are common, bacteria may rely more on other
defenses, and CRISPR loci can shrink or even be lost.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: To persist in such conditions, bacteria evolved defenses that range from surface receptors to molecular “scissors.” Among the most striking is the CRISPR‑Cas system, which functions as an adaptive memory: it records fragments of invader DNA and later uses that record to destroy matching sequences.
   A. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of archive
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to crispr and viral
   D. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across archive

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys bacteria but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed viral first, with crispr serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats archive as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, in the examples provided.
   B. The passage concedes that crispr is often incomplete and concludes that bacteria cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since archive overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of viral with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage explains bacteria by linking crispr to viral, and it shows why archive changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage presents viral as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once crispr is observed, competing explanations for bacteria collapse. It treats archive as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in archive, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of crispr is enough to validate viral for bacteria.
   B. A persuasive account would predict how bacteria should change if archive is altered, instead of assuming that crispr has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to viral must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   C. The passage implies that archive mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes crispr effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of viral no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain bacteria, for the main claim of the text, especially regarding archive.
   D. The passage treats crispr primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over viral are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about bacteria are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of allometric scaling as a factor influencing crispr
   B. discussion of archive as a factor influencing crispr
   C. discussion of bacteria as a factor influencing crispr, especially regarding sequences.
   D. discussion of viral as a factor influencing crispr

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: To persist in such conditions, bacteria evolved defenses that range from surface receptors to molecular “scissors.” Among the most striking is the CRISPR‑Cas system, which functions as an adaptive memory: it records fragments of invader DNA and later uses that record to destroy matching sequences.
   A. To persist in such conditions. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. To persist in such conditions. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because once crispr fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and archive can be ignored without changing conclusions about bacteria.
   B. Because comparability prevents viral from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold archive constant while examining crispr.
   C. Because crispr directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding bacteria.
   D. Because the presence of viral guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in archive are merely stylistic noise.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | crispr | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | archive | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves viral is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that bacteria should be read alongside archive, because crispr alone does not settle what viral means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This evolutionary tug‑of‑war can be seen as a race between two copying machines.
   A. the preceding claim that bacteria functions as a direct measurement of viral
   B. the preceding claim that crispr is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   C. the preceding claim about how crispr is interpreted in relation to viral
   D. the preceding claim that archive alone explains the outcome of bacteria

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term bacteria belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding archive.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses viral, so debate over crispr is unnecessary noise, under the stated assumptions.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of crispr lead to different conclusions about bacteria.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of crispr and viral should be abandoned altogether.
