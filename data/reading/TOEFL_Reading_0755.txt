Passage 0755: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 735)

Against that intuitive story, one sees why researchers have treated wealth accumulation gaps
as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality. audit studies in housing markets can make the pattern look unusually sharp;
still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike European migrant neighborhoods. [A] This becomes a
pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. the same summary statistic could
be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed in part because zoning rules and
land-use regulation shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. [B] This
detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested. The issue is not treating
wealth accumulation gaps as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore
separates detection from interpretation. [C] The passage returns to this point to clarify
what counts as evidence. [D] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors
to be discarded. In this sense, spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is the apparent regularity of wealth accumulation gaps, rather than a single headline
feature, that drives the first interpretation: wealth accumulation gaps is treated as a
direct readout of mechanism. If wealth accumulation gaps is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway is granted, then observations from European migrant neighborhoods would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. Rather than the caveat that
zoning rules and land-use regulation might reproduce the same pattern, the passage
emphasizes that the literature is full of such claims.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from
description to explanation be true, then the same observation—wealth accumulation gaps—must
be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat wealth accumulation gaps as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces
boundary conditions to be stated. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality across
neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one
wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the same observation—wealth
accumulation gaps—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat wealth accumulation gaps as an endpoint in one
account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts in another.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify zoning rules and land-use
regulation did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which audit studies in housing markets constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps
explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary. To be sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive
answer is strong, yet the result is a framework in which wealth accumulation gaps is
interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when informational asymmetries in housing search can mimic mobility constraints across space.
   B. The passage suggests that mobility constraints across space is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away informational asymmetries in housing search, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The author treats post-industrial cities as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: As a result, the most valuable observations are often taken during transitions, when competing mechanisms diverge most clearly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where audit studies in housing markets constrains path dependence from historical redlining
   B. The passage treats wealth accumulation gaps as a confounder and path dependence from historical redlining as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The author argues that audit studies in housing markets should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The discussion suggests that path dependence from historical redlining is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal panel data as a historical curiosity and does not discuss disparate exposure to pollution or path dependence from historical redlining. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because disparate exposure to pollution uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that path dependence from historical redlining is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal panel data are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal panel data as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that disparate exposure to pollution is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how path dependence from historical redlining can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from post-industrial cities. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal panel data with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because informational asymmetries in housing search dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   C. unclear
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like spatial autocorrelation analysis are needed

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. Since wealth accumulation gaps is observed in post-industrial cities, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. it prevents wealth accumulation gaps from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control zoning rules and land-use regulation
   C. Because wealth accumulation gaps appears, the mechanism must be unique, so zoning rules and land-use regulation can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once wealth accumulation gaps is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

7. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. credit market discrimination alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. disparate exposure to pollution specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. mobility tracking with administrative records as a device rather than as an analytic approach

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on audit studies in housing markets simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in large U.S. metropolitan areas and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates path dependence from historical redlining.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because wealth accumulation gaps uniquely identifies one mechanism.

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   B. mobility constraints across space
   C. the price of coal in 1700
