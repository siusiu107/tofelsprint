Passage 0053: Inflation Expectations, Salient Prices, and Why Stories Can Move Real Decisions (Economics)
=========================================================================================================
(Word count: 617)

Inflation is often described as a single number—“prices rose three percent this year”—but in
everyday life it is a mosaic. Some prices jump quickly, others barely move, and consumers
notice the ones they encounter most often. This difference matters because many economic
decisions depend not only on today’s prices but on what people expect prices to be tomorrow.
When households believe that the cost of groceries or rent will rise soon, they may buy
earlier, negotiate harder, or demand higher wages. When firms believe their input costs will
climb, they may reset menus, raise list prices, or seek cheaper suppliers. Expectations can
therefore shape inflation’s trajectory, not merely reflect it.

In textbook stories, expectations are anchored by a central signal: a stable monetary regime
convinces people that high inflation will not persist. In practice, expectations are formed
with imperfect information. Many households do not track official inflation statistics, and
even those who hear them may interpret them through personal experience. A commuter who sees
fuel prices swing weekly may infer “everything is getting expensive,” even if other
categories are stable. Similarly, a tenant facing a sharp rent increase may generalize that
shock to the whole economy. [A] The mind tends to overweight salient, frequent purchases,
turning a few loud price movements into a broader belief.

Firms, too, face frictions. Changing prices is not free. A restaurant that prints new menus,
retrains staff, and risks annoying customers has an incentive to adjust in discrete steps
rather than continuously. If managers expect input costs to keep rising, they may choose a
larger price increase now to avoid repeated adjustments later. Conversely, if they expect
inflation to ease, they may delay, absorbing short-term cost changes in margins. In this
way, expectations influence the timing and size of price resets, shaping the “stickiness”
that macroeconomists observe in aggregate data.

Expectations are also social. People talk. News headlines, employer memos, and social media
posts circulate narratives about what is happening to prices and why. A widely shared
story—“shipping costs are exploding,” “housing is unattainable,” or “discounts will
return”—can coordinate attention. Once attention is coordinated, behavior can synchronize:
many consumers rush to purchase, many firms adjust their markups, and what began as a story
becomes visible in transaction data. [B] The mechanism is not mystical. A narrative is a
compressed model that tells people which signals to treat as meaningful and which to ignore.

Researchers have shown that simply prompting people to recall recent price changes can shift
their reported inflation expectations. When asked about gasoline, respondents forecast
higher inflation than when asked about electronics. The difference reflects not only true
price dynamics but the memory architecture of consumers. Likewise, firms in sectors with
volatile costs—such as food—may build “inflation clauses” into contracts more readily than
firms in sectors where costs are stable. Contract design then feeds back into wage
bargaining and pricing decisions, spreading the impact of expectations through the economy’s
institutional plumbing.

None of this implies that expectations alone create inflation out of thin air. Physical
constraints—supply disruptions, productivity, and energy costs—still matter. Yet
expectations influence how shocks propagate. A one-time cost increase can fade if firms and
workers treat it as temporary; it can persist if they treat it as the start of a new regime
and adjust wages and prices accordingly. [C] The same shock, filtered through different
beliefs, can therefore leave different scars.

Thus, inflation is partly a coordination problem in a world of limited attention. [D]
Numbers matter, but so do the stories people use to make sense of those numbers, because
those stories can steer when—and by how much—prices and wages are reset.


Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author emphasize that inflation is “a mosaic” of different price movements?
   A. To show that people form expectations from uneven personal experiences rather than from one uniform price change
   B. To argue that official inflation measures are always fabricated
   C. To claim that only gasoline prices matter for inflation
   D. To suggest that firms never change prices

2. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because people cannot monitor every category, they rely on shortcuts that can systematically bias beliefs.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Factual] According to the passage, why might a restaurant raise prices by a larger amount at once?
   A. To avoid the repeated costs and customer disruption of frequent small changes if costs are expected to keep rising
   B. Because menus cannot be printed more than once a year by law
   C. Because customers always prefer higher prices
   D. Because input costs for restaurants never fluctuate

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about how narratives influence economic behavior in the passage?
   A. They can coordinate attention so that many actors respond similarly, making the story’s effects visible in data
   B. They eliminate physical constraints such as energy costs
   C. They prevent any wage bargaining from occurring
   D. They make prices change continuously without frictions

5. [Vocabulary] The word “salient” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. noticeable and attention-grabbing
   B. mathematically identical
   C. legally required
   D. chemically reactive

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as influences on inflation dynamics EXCEPT:
   A. supply disruptions
   B. productivity
   C. energy costs
   D. calcium carbonate formation in wet plaster

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the difference” refers to:
   A. how asking about gasoline versus electronics changes reported inflation expectations
   B. the gap between night and day temperatures in deserts
   C. the chemical signature of obsidian sources
   D. the duration of a microlensing anomaly

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains why expectations matter, shows how households and firms form beliefs, discusses narratives and frictions, then describes how expectations shape shock persistence
   B. It provides a timeline of central bank presidents
   C. It lists consumer prices without interpretation
   D. It argues that inflation is unrelated to wages

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that narratives are “compressed models”?
   A. They simplify complex information into a story that tells people which signals to treat as important
   B. They are detailed statistical tables listing every transaction
   C. They are contracts that set wages automatically
   D. They are manufacturing blueprints for menus

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Inflation is determined only by official statistics, so expectations cannot matter.
   B. The passage argues that inflation expectations shape consumer and firm behavior, are formed from salient personal price experiences and social narratives, and influence when prices and wages are reset, thereby affecting whether shocks fade or persist even though physical factors like energy and supply still matter.
   C. Firms adjust prices continuously without costs, so expectations have no effect on timing.
   D. Narratives create inflation entirely without any underlying shocks.
