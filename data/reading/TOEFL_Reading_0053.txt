Passage 0053: Inflation Expectations, Salient Prices, and Why Stories Can Move Real Decisions (Economics)
=========================================================================================================
(Word count: 617)

Inflation is often described as a single number—“prices rose three percent this year”—but in
everyday life it is a mosaic. Some prices jump quickly, others barely move, and consumers
notice the ones they encounter most often. This difference matters because many economic
decisions depend not only on today’s prices but on what people expect prices to be tomorrow.
When households believe that the cost of groceries or rent will rise soon, they may buy
earlier, negotiate harder, or demand higher wages. When firms believe their input costs will
climb, they may reset menus, raise list prices, or seek cheaper suppliers. Expectations can
therefore shape inflation’s trajectory, not merely reflect it.

In textbook stories, expectations are anchored by a central signal: a stable monetary regime
convinces people that high inflation will not persist. In practice, expectations are formed
with imperfect information. Many households do not track official inflation statistics, and
even those who hear them may interpret them through personal experience. A commuter who sees
fuel prices swing weekly may infer “everything is getting expensive,” even if other
categories are stable. Similarly, a tenant facing a sharp rent increase may generalize that
shock to the whole economy. [A] The mind tends to overweight salient, frequent purchases,
turning a few loud price movements into a broader belief.

Firms, too, face frictions. Changing prices is not free. A restaurant that prints new menus,
retrains staff, and risks annoying customers has an incentive to adjust in discrete steps
rather than continuously. If managers expect input costs to keep rising, they may choose a
larger price increase now to avoid repeated adjustments later. Conversely, if they expect
inflation to ease, they may delay, absorbing short-term cost changes in margins. In this
way, expectations influence the timing and size of price resets, shaping the “stickiness”
that macroeconomists observe in aggregate data.

Expectations are also social. People talk. News headlines, employer memos, and social media
posts circulate narratives about what is happening to prices and why. A widely shared
story—“shipping costs are exploding,” “housing is unattainable,” or “discounts will
return”—can coordinate attention. Once attention is coordinated, behavior can synchronize:
many consumers rush to purchase, many firms adjust their markups, and what began as a story
becomes visible in transaction data. [B] The mechanism is not mystical. A narrative is a
compressed model that tells people which signals to treat as meaningful and which to ignore.

Researchers have shown that simply prompting people to recall recent price changes can shift
their reported inflation expectations. When asked about gasoline, respondents forecast
higher inflation than when asked about electronics. The difference reflects not only true
price dynamics but the memory architecture of consumers. Likewise, firms in sectors with
volatile costs—such as food—may build “inflation clauses” into contracts more readily than
firms in sectors where costs are stable. Contract design then feeds back into wage
bargaining and pricing decisions, spreading the impact of expectations through the economy’s
institutional plumbing.

None of this implies that expectations alone create inflation out of thin air. Physical
constraints—supply disruptions, productivity, and energy costs—still matter. Yet
expectations influence how shocks propagate. A one-time cost increase can fade if firms and
workers treat it as temporary; it can persist if they treat it as the start of a new regime
and adjust wages and prices accordingly. [C] The same shock, filtered through different
beliefs, can therefore leave different scars.

Thus, inflation is partly a coordination problem in a world of limited attention. [D]
Numbers matter, but so do the stories people use to make sense of those numbers, because
those stories can steer when—and by how much—prices and wages are reset.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "volatile" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Likewise, firms in sectors with volatile costs—such as food—may build “inflation clauses” into contracts more readily than firms in sectors where costs are stable.
   A. complete and final, which would rule out further evaluation of people
   B. steady and essentially unchanging, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related, especially regarding people, as the argument develops.
   C. likely to change suddenly or unpredictably, as used to describe how the claim holds across people
   D. secondary background detail, despite references to prices and expectations, within the passage’s scope.

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents expectations as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once prices is observed, competing explanations for inflation collapse. It treats people as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, in the examples provided.
   B. The passage explains inflation by linking prices to expectations, and it shows why people changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   C. The passage concedes that prices is often incomplete and concludes that inflation cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since people overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of expectations with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   D. The passage surveys inflation but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed expectations first, with prices serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats people as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in people, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of prices is enough to validate expectations for inflation.
   B. The passage treats prices primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over expectations are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about inflation are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how inflation should change if people is altered, instead of assuming that prices has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to expectations must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage implies that people mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes prices effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of expectations no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain inflation, especially regarding prices, in the examples provided, especially regarding firms.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of archival bias as a factor influencing prices
   B. discussion of expectations as a factor influencing prices
   C. discussion of people as a factor influencing prices, especially regarding people.
   D. discussion of inflation as a factor influencing prices

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: A one-time cost increase can fade if firms and workers treat it as temporary; it can persist if they treat it as the start of a new regime and adjust wages and prices accordingly.
   A. A one-time cost increase can fade if firms and workers treat it as temporary. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. A one-time cost increase can fade if firms and workers treat it as temporary. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding costs, especially regarding people.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because prices directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding inflation.
   B. Because the presence of expectations guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in people are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because comparability prevents expectations from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold people constant while examining prices.
   D. Because once prices fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and people can be ignored without changing conclusions about inflation.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | prices | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | people | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves expectations is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that inflation should be read alongside people, because prices alone does not settle what expectations means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This difference matters because many economic decisions depend not only on today’s prices but on what people expect prices to be tomorrow.
   A. the idea that None of this implies that expectations alone create inflation out of thin air, within the passage’s scope.
   B. the idea that Some prices jump quickly, others barely move, and consumers notice the ones they encounter most often, for the phenomenon at issue.
   C. the idea that When households believe that the cost of groceries or rent will rise soon, they may buy earlier, negotiate harder, or demand higher wages...
   D. the idea that Inflation is often described as a single number—“prices rose three percent this year”—but in everyday life it is a mosaic
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses expectations, so debate over prices is unnecessary noise, especially regarding firms, especially regarding prices.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of prices lead to different conclusions about inflation.
   C. to show that the term inflation belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of prices and expectations should be abandoned altogether.
