Passage 0097: Sea Otters, Urchin Barrens, and Kelp Forest Cascades (Ecology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 606)

Kelp forests can look like underwater jungles: tall fronds rise toward the surface,
filtering light and creating habitat for fish, invertebrates, and marine mammals. Yet the
presence of kelp is not determined solely by water temperature and nutrients. In many
nearshore ecosystems, kelp depends on a chain of biological interactions in which predators,
herbivores, and plants are linked across trophic levels. A famous illustration involves sea
otters, sea urchins, and kelp along the North Pacific rim.

Sea urchins graze on kelp, especially on holdfasts and young shoots. When urchin populations
are low or are kept in check, kelp can grow rapidly, forming dense canopies. When urchins
become abundant, they can strip kelp from the seafloor, converting forests into “urchin
barrens,” rocky landscapes dominated by spines and sparse algae. The transition can be
abrupt, because once kelp is removed, urchins may persist by eating drift algae and by
surviving at low metabolic rates, preventing kelp from reestablishing. [A] The system can
therefore exhibit alternative stable states: a kelp-dominated state and an urchin-dominated
state.

Sea otters are important because they eat urchins, and their predation can shift the
balance. Where otters are present, urchin size and density often decline, and kelp cover
increases. Where otters are absent—whether due to historical fur hunting, predation by
killer whales in some regions, or other pressures—urchins can expand, and kelp can retreat.
This pattern is sometimes described as a trophic cascade, in which changes at the top
propagate downward. Yet the cascade is not a simple domino line. Otters do not eat urchins
uniformly; they may prefer large urchins, which can change size distributions, and they may
switch prey depending on availability. [B] The predator’s behavior is part of the ecology.

Physical conditions also modulate the cascade. Storms can tear kelp from the substrate,
creating gaps and drift algae that feed urchins. Warm-water events can reduce kelp growth,
making it easier for grazing to outrun regrowth. Conversely, high nutrient upwelling can
boost kelp, allowing forests to recover even under grazing pressure. In some places, kelp
species differ in resilience, and urchin species differ in feeding intensity, producing
regional variations in how “otter-driven” the system appears.

The cascade has consequences beyond kelp abundance. Kelp forests dampen waves and can reduce
coastal erosion by absorbing energy, while their structure provides nurseries for fish.
Carbon cycling is affected as well: kelp fixes carbon rapidly, and some of that organic
matter is exported to deeper waters. Urchin barrens, by contrast, support different
assemblages and often lower structural complexity. [C] Thus, a shift in predator presence
can reverberate through ecosystem services that people notice, even if they never see an
otter underwater.

Because humans have reintroduced otters in some regions and protected them in others, the
system has become a living experiment in recovery. Yet recovery can be slow, especially
where urchin barrens have persisted long enough to alter local conditions. In some
management contexts, divers remove urchins or promote urchin fisheries to help kelp return,
highlighting that cascades can be influenced by interventions at multiple levels.

Sea otters and kelp therefore exemplify how cause and effect can be ecological rather than
mechanical. [D] A predator does not “create” a forest directly, but by altering herbivore
pressure, it changes whether a plant can build the architecture that, in turn, shelters an
entire community.

As kelp returns, fish nurseries expand, and the forest-like structure can dampen waves,
subtly reshaping nearshore habitats.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, what can cause a kelp forest to shift into an “urchin barren”?
   A. high densities of sea urchins that graze kelp faster than it can regrow
   B. the carbonation of wet lime plaster
   C. a currency reform introducing the Rentenmark
   D. the propagation of fractures in cooling basalt

2. [Vocabulary] The phrase “alternative stable states” in the passage refers to:
   A. different persistent ecosystem configurations, such as kelp dominance versus urchin dominance
   B. two tuning systems used in music
   C. a choice between star cues and swell cues for navigation
   D. two methods of painting on wet plaster

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because barrens can persist, simply reducing urchins briefly may not guarantee immediate kelp recovery.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why the author says the cascade is “not a simple domino line”?
   A. Because predator preferences, prey switching, and physical conditions can alter how strongly predation affects kelp
   B. Because otters never eat urchins in any region
   C. Because storms always eliminate kelp regardless of grazing
   D. Because kelp can grow without sunlight

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention wave damping and fish nurseries?
   A. To show that kelp forests influence ecosystem services and coastal environments, making cascades relevant to humans
   B. To argue that otters are primarily important for painting materials
   C. To claim that urchin barrens increase habitat complexity
   D. To suggest that nutrient upwelling is irrelevant to kelp growth

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as factors that can modulate the cascade EXCEPT:
   A. storms
   B. warm-water events
   C. nutrient upwelling
   D. plasmid exchange among bacteria

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the predator’s behavior” refers to:
   A. otters’ prey preferences and switching, which influence urchin populations and thus kelp dynamics
   B. urchins’ ability to crystallize salts on walls
   C. kelp’s ability to print banknotes
   D. stars rising at fixed azimuths

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It describes the kelp–urchin interaction, introduces otter predation and trophic cascades, then explains modifying physical factors and broader consequences before noting management implications
   B. It lists marine species without explaining interactions
   C. It argues that predators have no effect on ecosystems
   D. It focuses only on the chemistry of seawater and ignores organisms

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the passage’s main point about otters and kelp?
   A. By reducing urchin grazing pressure, otters can indirectly allow kelp forests to persist, which then supports wider ecological communities
   B. Otters directly photosynthesize to create kelp tissue
   C. Urchins build kelp forests by carrying spores to rocks
   D. Kelp abundance is controlled only by banknote circulation

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage argues that kelp forests depend only on temperature and cannot be influenced by animals.
   B. The passage explains how kelp forests can collapse into urchin barrens when grazing pressure is high, and it describes sea otters as predators whose consumption of urchins can trigger trophic cascades that favor kelp; it emphasizes that the strength of the cascade varies with predator behavior and physical conditions and that the shift affects habitat structure and services such as wave damping and fish nurseries.
   C. The passage claims that urchins are harmless because they eat only drift algae.
   D. Sea otters are described as irrelevant because they never interact with urchins.
