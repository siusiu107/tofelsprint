Passage 0069: From Pidgins to Creoles, and What Contact Languages Reveal About Learning (Linguistics)
=====================================================================================================
(Word count: 604)

When people who do not share a language must communicate quickly, they often improvise. In
trading ports, plantations, and frontier settlements, simplified contact varieties can
emerge that borrow vocabulary from a dominant language while drawing on multiple speaker
backgrounds for pronunciation and grammar. Linguists often call such early contact varieties
pidgins, especially when they are not native languages but are used for specific functions.
The more contentious question is what happens when children grow up with such input and make
it their primary language. The resulting stabilized languages are often labeled creoles.

Early theories treated creoles as radically different from other languages, proposing that
they arise through abrupt “creolization,” in which children impose a new grammar when the
pidgin input is too limited. The linguist Derek Bickerton, for example, argued that children
rely on an innate “bioprogram,” producing similar grammatical structures across creoles
despite different lexifiers. In this view, similarities such as lack of inflectional
morphology or the use of preverbal tense- mood-aspect markers reflect default human
grammatical tendencies. [A] If correct, creoles would provide a window into the language
faculty under constrained input.

Other scholars proposed more gradualist accounts. They pointed out that many so-called
pidgins already have more structure than the caricature of “broken language” suggests, and
that adults can innovate grammar as well. Moreover, contact settings differ. Some
communities include many second-language learners and few children; others include stable
multilingualism with regular interaction between groups. Under these conditions, a contact
variety can expand over generations without a sharp break. Substrate influence—the transfer
of patterns from speakers’ original languages—can shape syntax and sound systems, while
superstrate influence provides much of the lexicon. [B] On this view, a creole’s features
are the historical outcome of population mixture, social stratification, and repeated
accommodation, not an instantaneous reset.

Data complicate simple dichotomies. Haitian Creole, for example, draws much vocabulary from
French, yet its tense-mood-aspect system and certain syntactic patterns diverge from French
in ways that align with West African substrate languages. Meanwhile, some Atlantic creoles
show more inflection than expected, and some contact languages that are native to
communities are not usually called creoles at all. The labels themselves can be political,
because calling a language a “creole” can be used to imply it is derivative or incomplete,
even when it is fully expressive. Linguists therefore increasingly treat “creole” as a
sociohistorical category rather than as a structural type.

The development of creoles also reveals how children learn. Children are not passive
recorders; they generalize patterns, regularize variation, and create stable conventions. If
adults provide inconsistent input, children can still converge on rules, selecting among
variants. This does not require a special creole module; it can reflect general learning
mechanisms. Experimental studies show that learners often reduce irregularity when faced
with variable input, producing grammars that are more systematic than the data they
received. [C] In contact communities, such tendencies can accelerate stabilization.

Ultimately, creole formation is best viewed as language change under extreme social
conditions. [D] Forced migration, unequal power, and multilingual pressure create unusual
distributions of speakers and inputs, and language responds by reorganizing. Whether the
result looks “abrupt” or “gradual” depends on how one samples the historical record and on
which social dynamics dominated the setting.

In plantation settings, the same word could be heard through multiple phonologies, so a
stable form emerged only after repeated accommodation.

Questions
---------
1. [Vocabulary] The word “lexifier” in the passage refers to:
   A. a child’s innate grammar program
   B. a method for dating sediments with luminescence
   C. the dominant source language that contributes much of the vocabulary
   D. a political label applied to all languages


2. [Factual] According to the passage, how are pidgins typically characterized in early stages?
   A. They are contact varieties used for specific functions and not usually acquired as native languages. This would occur only when accommodation dominates.
   B. They are solely contact varieties used for specific functions and not usually acquired as native languages. That would make haitian the primary constraint.
   C. They are contact varieties used for specific functions and not usually acquired as native languages.
   D. They are contact other used for specific functions and not usually acquired as native languages. This outcome would hold even if about stays constant.


3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: That hypothesis makes creoles central to debates about how much grammar is learned versus pre-specified.
   A. [B]
   B. [A]
   C. [D]
   D. [C]


4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why some linguists prefer to treat “creole” as a sociohistorical category?
   A. even though structural features vary widely, and the term can carry social judgments despite languages being fully expressive. This outcome would hold even if phonologies stays constant.
   B. Because structural features vary widely, and the term must carry social judgments despite languages being fully expressive. This outcome would hold even if french stays constant.
   C. Because structural features vary widely, and the term can carry social judgments despite derek being fully expressive. This would occur only when children dominates.
   D. Because structural features vary widely, and the term can carry social judgments despite languages being fully expressive.


5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as influences on creole features EXCEPT:
   A. substrate patterns from original languages in this discussion.
   B. oxygen storage in ceria used to buffer exhaust.
   C. social stratification and population mixture in this discussion.
   D. superstrate vocabulary sources in this discussion.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author contrast Bickerton’s “bioprogram” view with gradualist accounts?
   A. To show that there are solely competing explanations for similarities and differences among creoles and that social context matters for evaluating them. That would make haitian the primary constraint.
   B. To show that there are competing explanations for similarities and differences among plantation and that social context matters for evaluating them. That would make contact the primary constraint.
   C. To show that there are competing explanations for similarities and differences among creoles and that social context matters for evaluating them. This would occur only when contact dominates.
   D. To show that there are competing explanations for similarities and differences among creoles and that social context matters for evaluating them.


7. [Reference] In the passage, “the labels” refers to:
   A. terms such as ‘pidgin’ and ‘creole’ and the social implications attached to them. This would require contact to be the limiting factor.
   B. terms such as ‘pidgin’ and ‘creole’ and the social implications attached to them. This would occur only when french dominates.
   C. terms such as ‘pidgin’ and ‘linguists’ and the social implications attached to them. This outcome would hold even if different stays constant.
   D. terms such as ‘pidgin’ and ‘creole’ and the social implications attached to them.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It defines contact and creoles, presents an abrupt-creation hypothesis, contrasts it with gradualist and social explanations, then discusses evidence, political labeling, and learning mechanisms before concluding. This would occur only when derek dominates.
   B. It defines pidgins and creoles, presents an abrupt-creation hypothesis, contrasts it with gradualist and social explanations, then discusses evidence, political labeling, and learning mechanisms before concluding. This would occur only when languages dominates.
   C. It defines pidgins and creoles, presents an abrupt-creation hypothesis, contrasts it with gradualist and social explanations, then discusses evidence, political labeling, and learning mechanisms before concluding.
   D. It defines pidgins and creoles, presents an abrupt-creation hypothesis, contrasts it with gradualist and social explanations, then discusses evidence, political labeling, and learning mechanisms before concluding. This would occur only when derek dominates.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that children “regularize variation”?
   A. Learners can amplify inconsistency in the input by converging on stable rules and conventions. That would make languages the primary constraint.
   B. Learners can solely reduce inconsistency in the input by converging on stable rules and conventions. This would require plantation to be the limiting factor.
   C. Learners can reduce inconsistency in the input by converging on stable rules and conventions by tying the effect to african.
   D. Learners can reduce inconsistency in the input by converging on stable rules and conventions.
