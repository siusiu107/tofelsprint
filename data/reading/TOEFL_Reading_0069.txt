Passage 0069: From Pidgins to Creoles, and What Contact Languages Reveal About Learning (Linguistics)
=====================================================================================================
(Word count: 604)

When people who do not share a language must communicate quickly, they often improvise. In
trading ports, plantations, and frontier settlements, simplified contact varieties can
emerge that borrow vocabulary from a dominant language while drawing on multiple speaker
backgrounds for pronunciation and grammar. Linguists often call such early contact varieties
pidgins, especially when they are not native languages but are used for specific functions.
The more contentious question is what happens when children grow up with such input and make
it their primary language. The resulting stabilized languages are often labeled creoles.

Early theories treated creoles as radically different from other languages, proposing that
they arise through abrupt “creolization,” in which children impose a new grammar when the
pidgin input is too limited. The linguist Derek Bickerton, for example, argued that children
rely on an innate “bioprogram,” producing similar grammatical structures across creoles
despite different lexifiers. In this view, similarities such as lack of inflectional
morphology or the use of preverbal tense- mood-aspect markers reflect default human
grammatical tendencies. [A] If correct, creoles would provide a window into the language
faculty under constrained input.

Other scholars proposed more gradualist accounts. They pointed out that many so-called
pidgins already have more structure than the caricature of “broken language” suggests, and
that adults can innovate grammar as well. Moreover, contact settings differ. Some
communities include many second-language learners and few children; others include stable
multilingualism with regular interaction between groups. Under these conditions, a contact
variety can expand over generations without a sharp break. Substrate influence—the transfer
of patterns from speakers’ original languages—can shape syntax and sound systems, while
superstrate influence provides much of the lexicon. [B] On this view, a creole’s features
are the historical outcome of population mixture, social stratification, and repeated
accommodation, not an instantaneous reset.

Data complicate simple dichotomies. Haitian Creole, for example, draws much vocabulary from
French, yet its tense-mood-aspect system and certain syntactic patterns diverge from French
in ways that align with West African substrate languages. Meanwhile, some Atlantic creoles
show more inflection than expected, and some contact languages that are native to
communities are not usually called creoles at all. The labels themselves can be political,
because calling a language a “creole” can be used to imply it is derivative or incomplete,
even when it is fully expressive. Linguists therefore increasingly treat “creole” as a
sociohistorical category rather than as a structural type.

The development of creoles also reveals how children learn. Children are not passive
recorders; they generalize patterns, regularize variation, and create stable conventions. If
adults provide inconsistent input, children can still converge on rules, selecting among
variants. This does not require a special creole module; it can reflect general learning
mechanisms. Experimental studies show that learners often reduce irregularity when faced
with variable input, producing grammars that are more systematic than the data they
received. [C] In contact communities, such tendencies can accelerate stabilization.

Ultimately, creole formation is best viewed as language change under extreme social
conditions. [D] Forced migration, unequal power, and multilingual pressure create unusual
distributions of speakers and inputs, and language responds by reorganizing. Whether the
result looks “abrupt” or “gradual” depends on how one samples the historical record and on
which social dynamics dominated the setting.

In plantation settings, the same word could be heard through multiple phonologies, so a
stable form emerged only after repeated accommodation.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Early theories treated creoles as radically different from other languages, proposing that they arise through abrupt “creolization,” in which children impose a new grammar when the pidgin input is too limited.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across contact
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to children and creoles
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of contact
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains language by linking children to creoles, and it shows why contact changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents creoles as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once children is observed, competing explanations for language collapse. It treats contact as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage concedes that children is often incomplete and concludes that language cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since contact overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of creoles with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, for the main claim of the text.
   D. The passage surveys language but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed creoles first, with children serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats contact as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in contact, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of children is enough to validate creoles for language.
   B. The passage treats children primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over creoles are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about language are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how language should change if contact is altered, instead of assuming that children has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to creoles must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage implies that contact mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes children effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of creoles no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain language, especially regarding children, under the stated assumptions, in the context of the passage.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of contact as a factor influencing children
   B. discussion of language as a factor influencing children
   C. discussion of creoles as a factor influencing children, as the argument develops.
   D. discussion of instrument dead time as a factor influencing children

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Early theories treated creoles as radically different from other languages, proposing that they arise through abrupt “creolization,” in which children impose a new grammar when the pidgin input is too limited.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding children.
   B. Early theories treated creoles as radically different from other languages. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. Early theories treated creoles as radically different from other languages. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because the presence of creoles guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in contact are merely stylistic noise.
   B. Because once children fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and contact can be ignored without changing conclusions about language.
   C. Because comparability prevents creoles from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold contact constant while examining children.
   D. Because children directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding language.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | children | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | contact | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It proves creoles is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that language should be read alongside contact, because children alone does not settle what creoles means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This does not require a special creole module; it can reflect general learning mechanisms.
   A. the preceding claim that children is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   B. the preceding claim that contact alone explains the outcome of language
   C. the preceding claim that language functions as a direct measurement of creoles
   D. the preceding claim about how children is interpreted in relation to creoles

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of children and creoles should be abandoned altogether.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses creoles, so debate over children is unnecessary noise, especially regarding language.
   C. to show that the term language belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding children.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of children lead to different conclusions about language.
