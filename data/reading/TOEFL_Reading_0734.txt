Passage 0734: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 732)

When memory is tested repeatedly, researchers found that researchers have treated shifted
confidence judgments as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. Even if choice-induced preference paradigms can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using choice-induced preference paradigms under stable conditions, it is difficult to deny
that one frequently cited case from workplace decision settings appeared to support the
direct-readout view. Although the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in self-concept threat altered the baseline enough to
mute or mimic shifted confidence judgments. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, a
move that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Not until analysts began combining choice-induced preference paradigms with cross-site
comparisons was it clear that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which shifted confidence judgments could
be explained in more than one way because confounders like self-concept threat often co-vary
with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept
threat. [A] The argument hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation. by
comparing cases in which choice-induced preference paradigms constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author uses the detour to
show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. Admittedly, a single case
can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. [C] The author notes that generalization
requires more than a single well-chosen case. [D] At first glance, the pattern seems
obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. In this sense, dissonance reduction after
decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on self-concept threat, the interpretation
shifts, and many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization
as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized shifted confidence
judgments as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under replication. this
shift mattered for how evidence from workplace decision settings was generalized in part
because local conditions can change which processes generate shifted confidence judgments.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—shifted confidence judgments—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence.
Whereas popular summaries treat shifted confidence judgments as an endpoint invites a tidy
story, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. In this sense, self-justification
mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Admittedly,
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; nevertheless, the
result is a framework in which shifted confidence judgments is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This is why the author dwells on assumptions: without them, two teams can analyze the same record and still disagree honestly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal attitude surveys as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that devaluation of rejected alternatives is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal attitude surveys with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   C. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal attitude surveys are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal attitude surveys as a historical curiosity and does not discuss devaluation of rejected alternatives or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where choice-induced preference paradigms constrains measurement reactivity
   B. The discussion suggests that measurement reactivity is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The passage treats increased liking for chosen options as a confounder and measurement reactivity as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The passage implies that cross-national survey samples is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Using choice-induced preference paradigms under stable conditions, it is difficult to deny that one frequently cited case from workplace decision settings appeared to support the direct-readout view.
   A. devaluation of rejected alternatives specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. longitudinal attitude surveys as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. measurement reactivity alone, treated as the sole cause

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifted confidence judgments is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if implicit association tests produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. Since shifted confidence judgments is observed in workplace decision settings, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on behavioral priming designs simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in consumer choice studies and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies one mechanism.
