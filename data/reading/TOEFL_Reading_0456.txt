Passage 0456: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 746)

When long geodetic records are examined, one sees why researchers have treated transient
surface deformation as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow
slip. Although seafloor pressure sensors can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely
on familiar narratives.

Admittedly, the first model can fit one dataset extremely well; nevertheless, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
stress transfer after large events can shift baselines, altering whether transient surface
deformation is even comparable across cases, a move that means that a good fit is not the
same as a good explanation. Were stress transfer after large events is changed while the
nominal driver remains constant to fail, one should expect different outcomes when
conditions are perturbed. In this sense, megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Using seafloor pressure sensors under stable conditions, the interpretation shifts, and one
frequently cited case from the Cascadia subduction zone appeared to support the direct-
readout view. Despite the fact that the original fit looked visually decisive, later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in stress transfer after large events altered
the baseline enough to mute or mimic transient surface deformation. the passage treats this
episode as diagnostic, which helps explain why illustrates why boundary conditions must be
specified before generalization is attempted.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—transient surface
deformation—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat transient surface deformation as an endpoint, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. In this
sense, episodic tremor and slip is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Only by analysts began combining seafloor pressure sensors with cross-site comparisons was
the field forced to accept that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow
slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. [A]
That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which transient surface deformation could be explained in more than one way
in part because confounders like stress transfer after large events often co-vary with the
driver. [B] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism.
as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable. [C] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames
it as conditional. [D] Later comparisons reveal why this matters.

best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Although the temptation to
treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which
transient surface deformation is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather
than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where paleoseismic trenching constrains locked versus creeping patches
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'strain accumulation and release in subduction zones' refers to a different field altogether, not to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip.
   C. The passage implies that Sumatra–Andaman is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The discussion suggests that locked versus creeping patches is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | numerical rupture simulations | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | low-frequency tremor bursts | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | fluid overpressure in faults | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It makes stress transfer after large events irrelevant.
   B. Can be contaminated by background variability
   C. Depends on modeling priors
   D. Can mimic the target feature

3. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that numerical rupture simulations directly measures causes, meaning confounding from stress transfer after large events is impossible.
   B. Since low-frequency tremor bursts is observed in Sumatra–Andaman, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once low-frequency tremor bursts is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. it prevents low-frequency tremor bursts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control stress transfer after large events

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates locked versus creeping patches.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Japan Trench region and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on paleoseismic trenching simple.

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats numerical rupture simulations as a historical curiosity and does not discuss transient surface deformation or fluid overpressure in faults. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that transient surface deformation is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how fluid overpressure in faults can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Cascadia subduction zone. Finally, it maintains that tests combining numerical rupture simulations with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   C. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because transient surface deformation uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that fluid overpressure in faults is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using numerical rupture simulations are unnecessary.
   D. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like fluid overpressure in faults make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting numerical rupture simulations as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
