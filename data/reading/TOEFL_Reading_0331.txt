Passage 0331: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 770)

In policy discussions, researchers found that researchers have treated disparate exposure to
pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. While it is true that quasi-experimental policy evaluation can make
the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using quasi-experimental policy evaluation under stable conditions, the passage suggests one
frequently cited case from post-industrial cities appeared to support the direct-readout
view. Granted that the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis
showed that small shifts in informational asymmetries in housing search altered the baseline
enough to mute or mimic disparate exposure to pollution. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, which forces analysts to admit that illustrates why boundary conditions must be
specified before generalization is attempted. In this sense, spatial stratification in
cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely, unless analysts began combining quasi-experimental policy evaluation with cross-site
comparisons, does one see why claims about residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate exposure to
pollution could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like
informational asymmetries in housing search often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on informational asymmetries in housing
search, the author treats the complication as diagnostic, so many early studies framed
residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality as a single-mechanism
phenomenon. [A] The passage highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample
checks. Whereas those studies emphasized disparate exposure to pollution as a signature,
later work asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ.
[B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
this shift mattered for how evidence from post-industrial cities was generalized because, as
the author notes, local conditions can change which processes generate disparate exposure to
pollution. [C] The author uses the example to separate detection from interpretation. [D]
The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. In this sense, segregation-
driven inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

Not until analysts began combining quasi-experimental policy evaluation with cross-site
comparisons did claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate exposure to pollution
could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like informational
asymmetries in housing search often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move
that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Should one
wishes to move from description to explanation be true, then the same observation—disparate
exposure to pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint may
be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-
level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool
for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple
stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. To be sure, the temptation to treat a
tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, yet the result is a framework in which disparate
exposure to pollution is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The author emphasizes that a clean-looking curve can still encode hidden choices, especially when preprocessing is treated as neutral.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. it prevents wealth accumulation gaps from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control path dependence from historical redlining
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once wealth accumulation gaps is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if quasi-experimental policy evaluation produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. Because path dependence from historical redlining co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **coherent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Rarely, unless analysts began combining quasi-experimental policy evaluation with cross-site comparisons, does one see why claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
   A. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like mobility tracking with administrative records are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because path dependence from historical redlining dominates all evidence
   D. well organized

4. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when path dependence from historical redlining can mimic disparate exposure to pollution.
   B. The passage suggests that disparate exposure to pollution is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving mobility tracking with administrative records.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away path dependence from historical redlining, since variability is merely a measurement error.

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Samples only part of the system
   B. Shifts the baseline
   C. It makes path dependence from historical redlining irrelevant.
   D. Can be degenerate with another effect

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. zoning rules and land-use regulation alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. school-quality gradients specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. longitudinal panel data as a device rather than as an analytic approach

   A. wealth accumulation gaps
   B. audit studies in housing markets
   C. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   D. a list of Olympic medal counts

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like informational asymmetries in housing search make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting audit studies in housing markets as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that informational asymmetries in housing search is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using audit studies in housing markets are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that school-quality gradients is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how informational asymmetries in housing search can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from post-industrial cities. Finally, it maintains that tests combining audit studies in housing markets with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats audit studies in housing markets as a historical curiosity and does not discuss school-quality gradients or informational asymmetries in housing search. It ends without any methodological implication.

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The discussion suggests that zoning rules and land-use regulation is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where quasi-experimental policy evaluation constrains zoning rules and land-use regulation
   C. The author argues that quasi-experimental policy evaluation should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.

10. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates path dependence from historical redlining.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on longitudinal panel data simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in large U.S. metropolitan areas and everywhere else.
