Passage 0246: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 724)

From a cognitive-control perspective, researchers have treated increased liking for chosen
options as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
longitudinal attitude surveys can make the pattern look unusually sharp; still, the passage
argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
something that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike workplace decision settings. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because, as
the author notes, self-concept threat shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating
increased liking for chosen options as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the
assumptions differ. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but the apparent regularity of increased liking for chosen
options is what drives the first interpretation: increased liking for chosen options is
treated as a direct readout of mechanism. Should increased liking for chosen options is
uniquely produced by one causal pathway be true, then observations from workplace decision
settings would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. The issue is
not the caveat that self-concept threat might reproduce the same pattern; it is that the
literature is full of such claims.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The author notes that
generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. Should one wishes to move from
description to explanation be true, then the same observation—increased liking for chosen
options—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The
argument hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation. Whereas popular
summaries treat increased liking for chosen options as an endpoint may be convenient, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is
scientifically revealing. [C] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors
to be discarded. [D] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. In this
sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify self-concept threat, does
one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which longitudinal attitude surveys constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, a move that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author
does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—increased liking for chosen
options—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas
popular summaries treat increased liking for chosen options as an endpoint in one account,
the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts in another. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even though
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which increased liking for chosen options is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **approximate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: If one wishes to move from description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—increased liking for chosen options—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. rough
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like longitudinal attitude surveys are needed
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

2. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage suggests that selective memory for supporting evidence is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The author treats cross-national survey samples as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when measurement reactivity can mimic selective memory for supporting evidence.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using behavioral priming designs.

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on choice-induced preference paradigms simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-national survey samples and everywhere else.

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The author notes that a single dramatic example can mislead if it is treated as representative rather than as diagnostic.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using behavioral priming designs are unnecessary.
   B. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that selective memory for supporting evidence is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from political opinion panels. Finally, it maintains that tests combining behavioral priming designs with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats behavioral priming designs as a historical curiosity and does not discuss selective memory for supporting evidence or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting behavioral priming designs as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize model assumptions?
   A. Because cultural norms about consistency co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. Since selective memory for supporting evidence is observed in cross-national survey samples, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. Because selective memory for supporting evidence appears, the mechanism must be unique, so cultural norms about consistency can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the author’s favorite color
   B. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   C. longitudinal attitude surveys
   D. increased liking for chosen options

   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces behavioral priming designs with intuition.
   B. Can be contaminated by background variability
   C. It proves devaluation of rejected alternatives is unique.
   D. It makes measurement reactivity irrelevant.

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The passage implies that political opinion panels is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author argues that choice-induced preference paradigms should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The discussion suggests that cultural norms about consistency is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where choice-induced preference paradigms constrains cultural norms about consistency

10. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: The issue is not the caveat that self-concept threat might reproduce the same pattern; it is that the literature is full of such claims.
