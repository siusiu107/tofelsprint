Passage 0089: Microplastics as Changing Materials: Photodegradation, Additives, and Biofilms (Environmental Chemistry)
======================================================================================================================
(Word count: 614)

Microplastics are often described as tiny pieces of a larger problem, but their smallness is
precisely what makes them difficult. A plastic bottle is visible and removable; a
millimeter-scale fragment can disperse through water columns, settle into sediments, or be
ingested by organisms. Moreover, microplastics are not chemically inert confetti. Their
surfaces age, their additives migrate, and their interactions with light and microbes can
change what they are and how they behave.

One important transformation is photodegradation. Many polymers absorb ultraviolet
radiation, which can break chemical bonds and generate free radicals. In polyethylene, for
example, UV exposure can initiate chain scission, producing shorter polymer segments and
introducing oxygen-containing functional groups through oxidation. The surface becomes more
brittle, increasing fragmentation, so that sunlight can, paradoxically, create more
microplastics from larger debris. [A] The fragment is not merely shrinking; its chemistry is
being rewritten at the surface.

Additives complicate the picture. Plastics often contain plasticizers, stabilizers,
pigments, and flame retardants that are not covalently bound to the polymer backbone. Over
time, these compounds can leach into surrounding water or attach to biofilms. Some additives
are themselves biologically active, raising concerns that microplastics can act as delivery
vehicles for chemicals. Yet the direction is not only outward. Hydrophobic pollutants in the
environment can sorb onto plastic surfaces, concentrating compounds that were previously
dilute. Whether ingestion of a particle then transfers pollutants into tissues depends on
the particle’s residence time, the gut chemistry of the organism, and the affinity of the
compounds for lipids versus plastics.

Biology interacts with physics through biofilms. Microbes colonize plastic surfaces,
creating slimy layers that alter density and surface charge. A buoyant fragment may sink
after biofouling increases its effective density, shifting it from surface transport to
benthic deposition. Biofilms can also change how particles are eaten: a plastic fragment
coated in microbial exudates may resemble food more than a clean fragment does. In that way,
microbial ecology can shape exposure routes.

In freshwater systems, fibers from textiles are common, released during washing and
transported through wastewater. Treatment plants capture some fibers in sludge, but the
captured fraction can still reach soils if sludge is used as fertilizer. In marine systems,
pellets and fragments can be carried by currents, accumulating in gyres or washing onto
shores. The distribution is therefore not a simple “ocean problem.” It is a coupled
land–water problem in which consumption, waste management, and hydrology interact.

The consequences are still being mapped. Some studies show physical blockage or reduced
feeding in small organisms; others find subtle changes in gene expression or inflammation.
Because microplastics differ in size, polymer type, and additive content, effects can vary.
[B] A single headline about “microplastics” can hide a spectrum of exposures and mechanisms.

For environmental science, microplastics are a reminder that materials change after release.
[C] A polymer that was engineered for durability can, under sunlight and abrasion, transform
into reactive surfaces and mobile particles. [D] Understanding their impacts therefore
requires tracking not only where particles go, but also what they become.

Additives such as plasticizers can migrate outward, so a fragment’s chemistry can change
over time even if its polymer backbone remains.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual] According to the passage, what is one effect of photodegradation on certain polymers such as polyethylene?
   A. It can break bonds and make surfaces brittle, promoting further fragmentation while introducing oxygen-containing groups
   B. It permanently prevents any further fragmentation by hardening the polymer
   C. It converts plastic into methane hydrate in sediments
   D. It changes polymer color only without affecting structure

2. [Vocabulary] The word “sorb” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. to attach to a surface through adsorption or absorption
   B. to dissolve completely into water
   C. to be emitted as visible light
   D. to be cross-dated by ring patterns

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: These chemical changes can alter how the particle interacts with water, microbes, and other pollutants.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why microplastics may act as “delivery vehicles” for chemicals?
   A. Because additives can leach out and pollutants can accumulate on surfaces, potentially transferring chemicals during ingestion
   B. Because plastics create new chemicals through photosynthesis
   C. Because wastewater plants convert microplastics into antibiotics
   D. Because biofilms always neutralize toxic compounds

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following processes affecting microplastics are mentioned EXCEPT:
   A. UV-driven bond breaking and oxidation
   B. additive leaching and pollutant sorption
   C. biofilm formation altering density
   D. epigenetic caste determination in honeybees

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author emphasize that microplastics are not “chemically inert confetti”?
   A. To argue that microplastics can change chemically and interact with pollutants and organisms, affecting risk in complex ways
   B. To claim that microplastics are harmless because they are colorful
   C. To suggest that the only problem is large plastic bottles
   D. To propose that microplastics can be removed by simple nets everywhere

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the direction is not only outward” refers to:
   A. chemicals can both leach out of plastics and also sorb onto them from the environment
   B. microplastics moving only from oceans to land
   C. photodegradation traveling backward in time
   D. fibers traveling only upward in the water column

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces microplastics as both physical and chemical entities, explains photodegradation and additive dynamics, then discusses biofilms and transport pathways before concluding with implications for understanding impacts
   B. It lists marine animals that eat plastic without explaining mechanisms
   C. It argues that microplastics are identical in every environment
   D. It focuses only on recycling economics and omits chemistry

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that “microplastics” hides a spectrum?
   A. Different particle types, sizes, polymers, and additives create diverse exposures and biological mechanisms, so effects vary
   B. All microplastics have the same composition and therefore identical effects
   C. Only fibers matter, so fragments can be ignored
   D. Variation is irrelevant because pollutants never attach to plastics

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Microplastics are inert and remain chemically unchanged after entering the environment.
   B. The passage explains that microplastics undergo transformations such as UV-driven photodegradation, additive leaching, pollutant sorption, and biofilm formation that alter their chemistry and transport, and it argues that their impacts depend on diverse particle properties and pathways across land and water systems.
   C. Microplastics are produced only by volcanic eruptions and therefore can be eliminated by ash removal.
   D. Biofilms prevent microplastics from moving, so distribution is confined to beaches.
