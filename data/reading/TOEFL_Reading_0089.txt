Passage 0089: Microplastics as Changing Materials: Photodegradation, Additives, and Biofilms (Environmental Chemistry)
======================================================================================================================
(Word count: 614)

Microplastics are often described as tiny pieces of a larger problem, but their smallness is
precisely what makes them difficult. A plastic bottle is visible and removable; a
millimeter-scale fragment can disperse through water columns, settle into sediments, or be
ingested by organisms. Moreover, microplastics are not chemically inert confetti. Their
surfaces age, their additives migrate, and their interactions with light and microbes can
change what they are and how they behave.

One important transformation is photodegradation. Many polymers absorb ultraviolet
radiation, which can break chemical bonds and generate free radicals. In polyethylene, for
example, UV exposure can initiate chain scission, producing shorter polymer segments and
introducing oxygen-containing functional groups through oxidation. The surface becomes more
brittle, increasing fragmentation, so that sunlight can, paradoxically, create more
microplastics from larger debris. [A] The fragment is not merely shrinking; its chemistry is
being rewritten at the surface.

Additives complicate the picture. Plastics often contain plasticizers, stabilizers,
pigments, and flame retardants that are not covalently bound to the polymer backbone. Over
time, these compounds can leach into surrounding water or attach to biofilms. Some additives
are themselves biologically active, raising concerns that microplastics can act as delivery
vehicles for chemicals. Yet the direction is not only outward. Hydrophobic pollutants in the
environment can sorb onto plastic surfaces, concentrating compounds that were previously
dilute. Whether ingestion of a particle then transfers pollutants into tissues depends on
the particle’s residence time, the gut chemistry of the organism, and the affinity of the
compounds for lipids versus plastics.

Biology interacts with physics through biofilms. Microbes colonize plastic surfaces,
creating slimy layers that alter density and surface charge. A buoyant fragment may sink
after biofouling increases its effective density, shifting it from surface transport to
benthic deposition. Biofilms can also change how particles are eaten: a plastic fragment
coated in microbial exudates may resemble food more than a clean fragment does. In that way,
microbial ecology can shape exposure routes.

In freshwater systems, fibers from textiles are common, released during washing and
transported through wastewater. Treatment plants capture some fibers in sludge, but the
captured fraction can still reach soils if sludge is used as fertilizer. In marine systems,
pellets and fragments can be carried by currents, accumulating in gyres or washing onto
shores. The distribution is therefore not a simple “ocean problem.” It is a coupled
land–water problem in which consumption, waste management, and hydrology interact.

The consequences are still being mapped. Some studies show physical blockage or reduced
feeding in small organisms; others find subtle changes in gene expression or inflammation.
Because microplastics differ in size, polymer type, and additive content, effects can vary.
[B] A single headline about “microplastics” can hide a spectrum of exposures and mechanisms.

For environmental science, microplastics are a reminder that materials change after release.
[C] A polymer that was engineered for durability can, under sunlight and abrasion, transform
into reactive surfaces and mobile particles. [D] Understanding their impacts therefore
requires tracking not only where particles go, but also what they become.

Additives such as plasticizers can migrate outward, so a fragment’s chemistry can change
over time even if its polymer backbone remains.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Whether ingestion of a particle then transfers pollutants into tissues depends on the particle’s residence time, the gut chemistry of the organism, and the affinity of the compounds for lipids versus plastics.
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across change
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of change
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to polymer and additives

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains fragment by linking polymer to additives, and it shows why change changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage surveys fragment but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed additives first, with polymer serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats change as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, as the discussion implies.
   C. The passage presents additives as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once polymer is observed, competing explanations for fragment collapse. It treats change as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   D. The passage concedes that polymer is often incomplete and concludes that fragment cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since change overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of additives with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that change mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes polymer effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of additives no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain fragment, within the passage’s scope, especially regarding additives, especially regarding additives.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in change, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of polymer is enough to validate additives for fragment.
   C. The passage treats polymer primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over additives are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about fragment are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how fragment should change if change is altered, instead of assuming that polymer has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to additives must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of radiocarbon reservoir effects as a factor influencing polymer
   B. discussion of change as a factor influencing polymer
   C. discussion of additives as a factor influencing polymer, especially regarding change.
   D. discussion of fragment as a factor influencing polymer

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Whether ingestion of a particle then transfers pollutants into tissues depends on the particle’s residence time, the gut chemistry of the organism, and the affinity of the compounds for lipids versus plastics.
   A. Whether ingestion of a particle then transfers pollutants into tissues depends on the particle’s residence time. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   B. Whether ingestion of a particle then transfers pollutants into tissues depends on the particle’s residence time. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, under the stated assumptions.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding microplastics, in the examples provided.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because polymer directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding fragment.
   B. Because once polymer fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and change can be ignored without changing conclusions about fragment.
   C. Because comparability prevents additives from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold change constant while examining polymer.
   D. Because the presence of additives guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in change are merely stylistic noise.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | polymer | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | change | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It proves additives is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that fragment should be read alongside change, because polymer alone does not settle what additives means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "these" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Over time, these compounds can leach into surrounding water or attach to biofilms.
   A. the idea that [D] Understanding their impacts therefore requires tracking not only where particles go, but also what they become
   B. the idea that Some additives are themselves biologically active, raising concerns that microplastics can act as delivery vehicles for chemicals, as framed by the author.
   C. the idea that Plastics often contain plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, and flame retardants that are not covalently bound to the polymer backbone
   D. the idea that Additives complicate the picture, under the stated assumptions, under the stated assumptions, in the setting discussed.
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term fragment belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding fragment.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of polymer lead to different conclusions about fragment.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses additives, so debate over polymer is unnecessary noise, especially regarding additives.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of polymer and additives should be abandoned altogether.
