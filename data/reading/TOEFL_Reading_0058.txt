Passage 0058: Phenological Mismatch and When Flowers and Pollinators Lose Synchrony (Ecology)
=============================================================================================
(Word count: 602)

In spring, timing can be as important as abundance. Many plants rely on animals to move
pollen, and many pollinators rely on flowers for nectar and pollen. If flowers bloom when
pollinators are active, both sides benefit. If their schedules drift apart, a plant may set
fewer seeds and a pollinator may find less food. This problem, known as phenological
mismatch, has become more prominent as climates warm unevenly across seasons and regions.

Plants often time flowering using temperature cues, day length, and accumulated “degree
days.” A warm spell can push buds to open earlier than usual. Pollinators, however, may use
different cues. Some insects emerge based on soil temperature at their nesting depth; others
rely on photoperiod, which does not change with climate. A bumblebee queen might appear when
her fat stores and ambient temperature permit flight, whereas a particular wildflower might
respond sharply to early warmth. [A] If spring arrives in fits and starts—warm days followed
by cold snaps—plants may advance more than pollinators, increasing the chance that peak
bloom precedes peak foraging.

Mismatch is not always catastrophic because ecosystems have flexibility. Many plants attract
multiple pollinator species, and pollinators often visit multiple plants. If one bee species
is late, another might substitute. Yet specialization exists. Some orchids are pollinated by
a narrow set of insects; some bees are more efficient on particular flower shapes. Moreover,
even generalists can be constrained by weather. A cold, windy week can keep bees in nests,
while flowers continue to age. Because many flowers have a short fertile window, a delay of
days can reduce seed production even if pollinators return later.

The consequences can cascade. Reduced seed set can lower plant recruitment, altering future
flower abundance. If a pollinator experiences repeated food shortages during critical life
stages—such as when larvae are developing—colony growth can slow and fewer new queens may be
produced. [B] Over multiple years, a subtle timing gap can become a demographic problem, not
through immediate die-offs, but through fewer successful births on both sides.

Mismatch also interacts with habitat fragmentation. In a large, diverse landscape, a
pollinator can move to another patch where flowers are still blooming. In a fragmented
landscape, options shrink. A small remnant meadow may offer only a brief burst of bloom, and
if that burst is mistimed, the pollinator has nowhere nearby to compensate. Agricultural
landscapes can worsen this by providing mass flowering crops that bloom for a short period
and then leave little forage, amplifying the importance of wildflowers that fill gaps. If
those wildflowers shift in time, the buffer weakens.

Researchers monitor mismatch using long-term observations: first bloom dates, insect
emergence records, and pollen loads on captured insects. They also use experiments, such as
warming plots with open-top chambers, to see how species respond when temperatures are
nudged upward. The emerging picture is nuanced. Some pairs stay synchronized because both
respond to similar cues; others drift apart. In some cases, pollinators adjust by changing
activity periods or by expanding diets; in others, plants evolve altered flowering times.
Evolution, however, requires variation and time, and rapid environmental change can outpace
it.

Phenological mismatch is therefore a problem of coordination under changing clocks. [C] It
reminds ecologists that the same species can persist in isolation yet fail in interaction if
timing slips. [D] In spring, it is not enough that flowers exist and pollinators exist;
their calendars must overlap long enough for pollen to move and for energy to flow.

When flowering shifts earlier while pollinators emerge on an older schedule, the mismatch
can reduce seed set even if neither species disappears.


Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] The word “phenological” in the passage is closest in meaning to:

   C. related to political decision-making
   D. related to volcanic trace elements

2. [Inference] What can be inferred about why photoperiod-based cues can contribute to mismatch under warming?
   A. Day length stays constant across years, so organisms relying on it may not advance as quickly as temperature-responsive species
   B. Photoperiod changes dramatically with climate, forcing insects to emerge earlier
   C. Photoperiod prevents any insects from flying in spring
   D. Plants cannot detect temperature at all

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In that case, the two partners are reading different calendars even while living in the same place.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Factual] According to the passage, why can a few days of delay reduce seed production even if pollinators return later?
   A. Many flowers have a short fertile window and can age past effective pollination
   B. Bees destroy pollen after visiting a flower once
   C. Plants stop producing nectar immediately after sunrise
   D. Wind always replaces animal pollination after a delay

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are described as factors affecting mismatch EXCEPT:
   A. warm spells and cold snaps
   B. habitat fragmentation limiting alternative forage patches
   C. specialization between certain plants and pollinators
   D. ion migration changing solar-cell voltage landscapes

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention agricultural landscapes with mass flowering crops?
   A. To show how short crop bloom periods can make wildflower timing more important as a buffer for pollinators
   B. To argue that crops never need pollinators
   C. To claim that agriculture eliminates all mismatches automatically
   D. To suggest that fragmentation helps pollinators by simplifying choices

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the consequences” refers to:
   A. demographic and community effects that can follow from reduced seed set and food shortages due to timing gaps
   B. the chemical formation of malic acid in CAM plants only
   C. the printing cost of copper plates
   D. the depth of ocean isopycnals

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It defines phenological mismatch, explains differing cues for plants and pollinators, discusses ecological and demographic consequences, then examines landscape context, monitoring, and potential adaptation
   B. It lists pollinator species without describing timing
   C. It argues that mismatches are always catastrophic immediately
   D. It focuses only on genetics and ignores climate cues

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that interactions can fail even if species persist?
   A. Species may survive separately, but if their activity periods no longer overlap, pollination and food exchange can break down
   B. If species persist, interactions always remain unchanged
   C. Timing never matters in ecological relationships
   D. Only extinction can alter pollination networks

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Phenological mismatch occurs only when pollinators disappear entirely from a region.
   B. The passage explains phenological mismatch as a timing gap between flowering and pollinator activity driven by different environmental cues, shows how short fertile windows and demographic effects can magnify small delays, and argues that fragmentation and changing climate can worsen coordination problems even while adaptation is possible but not guaranteed.
   C. Plants and pollinators always respond to identical cues, so warming cannot affect synchronization.
   D. Mismatch is mainly caused by printed diagrams spreading incorrect flower images.
