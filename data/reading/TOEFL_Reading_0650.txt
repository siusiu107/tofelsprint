Passage 0650: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 660)

In policy discussions, the passage argues that researchers have treated mobility constraints
across space as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Though audit studies in housing markets can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify zoning rules and land-use
regulation did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which audit studies in housing markets constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Despite the fact that a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, spatial stratification in
cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Using audit studies in housing markets under stable conditions, one frequently cited case
from rapidly growing Sun Belt regions appeared to support the direct-readout view. Though
the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small
shifts in zoning rules and land-use regulation altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic
mobility constraints across space. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which
illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on zoning rules and land-use regulation,
the interpretation shifts, and many early studies framed residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those
studies emphasized mobility constraints across space as a signature looks decisive, later
work asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes
more predictive under replication. this shift mattered for how evidence from rapidly growing
Sun Belt regions was generalized largely because local conditions can change which processes
generate mobility constraints across space. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality
across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood
inequality: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] Later
comparisons reveal why this matters. Unless one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—mobility constraints across space—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence.
[B] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested. Whereas popular
summaries treat mobility constraints across space as an endpoint is easy to measure, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is
harder to interpret without assumptions. [C] This point forces the reader to consider how
confounders enter the pipeline. [D] The author implies that replication is informative only
when protocols are comparable. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool
for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple
stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Although the temptation to treat a
tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which mobility
constraints across space is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats post-industrial cities as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when informational asymmetries in housing search can mimic mobility constraints across space.
   C. The passage suggests that mobility constraints across space is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving longitudinal panel data.

2. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. Since disparate exposure to pollution is observed in large U.S. metropolitan areas, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if audit studies in housing markets produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. it prevents disparate exposure to pollution from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control path dependence from historical redlining
   D. Because disparate exposure to pollution appears, the mechanism must be unique, so path dependence from historical redlining can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

3. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | longitudinal panel data | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | disparate exposure to pollution | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | path dependence from historical redlining | Changes the apparent slope |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Changes the apparent slope
   B. Requires careful calibration
   C. It proves school-quality gradients is unique.
   D. May be muted by other processes

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. spatial autocorrelation analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. mobility constraints across space specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. zoning rules and land-use regulation alone, treated as the sole cause

5. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. longitudinal panel data
   B. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   C. the author’s favorite color
   D. mobility constraints across space

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like informational asymmetries in housing search make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal panel data as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how informational asymmetries in housing search can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from rapidly growing Sun Belt regions. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal panel data with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   C. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that informational asymmetries in housing search is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal panel data are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal panel data as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or informational asymmetries in housing search. It ends without any methodological implication.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates zoning rules and land-use regulation.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in post-industrial cities and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on mobility tracking with administrative records simple.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because wealth accumulation gaps uniquely identifies one mechanism.

9. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **approximate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [A] Later comparisons reveal why this matters.
   A. rough
   B. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because zoning rules and land-use regulation dominates all evidence
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like mobility tracking with administrative records are needed

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where quasi-experimental policy evaluation constrains path dependence from historical redlining
   B. The passage treats wealth accumulation gaps as a confounder and path dependence from historical redlining as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The author argues that quasi-experimental policy evaluation should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The passage implies that large U.S. metropolitan areas is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
