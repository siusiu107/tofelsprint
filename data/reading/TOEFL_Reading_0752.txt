Passage 0752: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 760)

During recent marine heatwaves, one sees why researchers have treated mortality and phase
shifts as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves. Even if
degree-heating-week metrics can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues
that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for;
this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives. Working with sparse records and limited controls on shading and cooling
refugia, the passage suggests many early studies framed coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized mortality and
phase shifts as a signature in one account, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ in another. this shift mattered for how
evidence from the Coral Triangle was generalized because local conditions can change which
processes generate mortality and phase shifts, which is why replication matters. In this
sense, thermal bleaching events is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label. If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the
passage presents as the lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—mortality and phase shifts—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat mortality and phase shifts as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder
to interpret without assumptions. Rarely has it been the case that claims about coral
bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions, at least before analysts began combining degree-heating-
week metrics with cross-site comparisons. the goal was to break degeneracies in which
mortality and phase shifts could be explained in more than one way largely because
confounders like shading and cooling refugia often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
an outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. Rarely, unless the
field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify shading and cooling refugia, does one see
why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] This is
presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. by comparing
cases in which degree-heating-week metrics constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, a move that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] That point is not rhetorical; it controls
which prediction follows. Granted that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C]
The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. [D] The discussion makes clear
that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. In this sense, loss of symbiotic
zooxanthellae under heat stress is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label. Using degree-heating-week metrics under stable conditions, it is difficult to
deny that one frequently cited case from the Coral Triangle appeared to support the direct-
readout view. While it is true that the original fit looked visually decisive, later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in shading and cooling refugia altered the
baseline enough to mute or mimic mortality and phase shifts. the passage treats this episode
as diagnostic, which helps explain why illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted. Rarely has it been the case that claims about coral
bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions, at least before analysts began combining degree-heating-
week metrics with cross-site comparisons. the goal was to break degeneracies in which
mortality and phase shifts could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
shading and cooling refugia often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency
about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, reef-scale bleaching
episodes is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end,
the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces
competing assumptions into the open.

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: Rarely has it been the case that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions, at least before analysts began combining degree-heating-week metrics with cross-site comparisons.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because changes in reef fish assemblages uniquely identifies one mechanism.

   D. The passage suggests that reduced photosynthetic efficiency is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. Since changes in reef fish assemblages is observed in Red Sea reefs, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. it prevents changes in reef fish assemblages from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control compound stressors such as acidification and pollution
   C. Because compound stressors such as acidification and pollution co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once changes in reef fish assemblages is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The passage treats shifts in carbonate accretion as a confounder and shading and cooling refugia as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The author argues that degree-heating-week metrics should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'reef-scale bleaching episodes' refers to a different field altogether, not to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where degree-heating-week metrics constrains shading and cooling refugia

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that changes in reef fish assemblages is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how shading and cooling refugia can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Red Sea reefs. Finally, it maintains that tests combining photophysiology measurements with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   B. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like shading and cooling refugia make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting photophysiology measurements as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats photophysiology measurements as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in reef fish assemblages or shading and cooling refugia. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because changes in reef fish assemblages uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that shading and cooling refugia is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using photophysiology measurements are unnecessary.
