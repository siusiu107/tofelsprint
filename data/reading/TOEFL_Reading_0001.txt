Passage 0001: Lyman‑alpha Signatures of Exoplanet Atmospheric Escape (Astronomy)
================================================================================
(Word count: 688)

When astronomers say that a planet is “losing its atmosphere,” they do not mean that gas
simply drifts away like smoke. Escape, on the scale of a planet, begins with energy.
Ultraviolet radiation from a star heats the upper atmosphere, and if that heating is strong
enough, the highest layers expand until they are no longer bound tightly to the planet. The
process is most dramatic for close-in planets whose gravity is modest and whose stars flare
frequently, because each flare delivers a pulse of energy that can briefly inflate the
atmosphere like a balloon.

The most direct evidence for escape comes from hydrogen, the lightest element, which is
easier to lift out of a gravitational well than heavier molecules. During a transit,
hydrogen in the upper atmosphere can absorb starlight at the Lyman‑alpha wavelength,
producing an extra dip beyond what the planet’s solid body would cause. Yet a dip in
Lyman‑alpha is not a simple “hydrogen present” stamp. The line can be reshaped by the star’s
own activity, and it can be partly erased by interstellar hydrogen between the star and
Earth. Accordingly, the observer must read not only the depth of absorption but also its
timing: does it appear mainly during transit, or does it linger before and after, implying a
trailing tail of gas?

Two physical pictures compete for what that tail looks like. In a thermal picture, heating
drives a roughly symmetric outflow that accelerates as pressure falls with altitude,
producing a broad, slow wind. In a radiation‑pressure picture, stellar photons push hydrogen
atoms, so the escaping gas is swept into a comet‑like tail that can extend far behind the
planet. [A] If the tail is real, absorption should persist after the planet’s disk has
finished crossing the star, because the gas continues to block light even when the planet
itself no longer does. [B] If, instead, the line’s depth changes mainly with stellar
variability, the “tail” might be a mirage produced by a star whose emission fluctuates on
the same timescale as a transit. [C]

A case that forced astronomers to separate these explanations involved a hot Neptune
observed over several visits. In one visit, the Lyman‑alpha dip began slightly before the
optical transit and lasted long after, while in another visit, the early absorption vanished
but the late absorption remained. That asymmetry is hard to produce with a perfectly
symmetric thermal wind, because thermal expansion does not naturally create leading
absorption without some additional force. However, the same asymmetry is also difficult to
attribute to stellar flickering alone, since the late absorption repeated at nearly the same
orbital phase even when the star’s overall ultraviolet brightness differed. The result
pushed researchers toward a hybrid view in which thermal heating launches gas upward, while
radiation pressure and stellar wind shape where that gas travels.

Once gas escapes, it does not merely thin the upper atmosphere; it can change the planet’s
chemistry over time. If hydrogen is removed preferentially, heavier molecules become
relatively more abundant, and the mean molecular weight can rise, altering scale heights and
making future spectral features harder to detect. Furthermore, if the escaping wind
interacts with ionized particles from the star, it can form a bow shock that redirects
energy and influences where ions are created. [D] Thus, atmospheric escape is not a single
event but a continuing interaction between radiation, gravity, and plasma, one that can
sculpt the atmosphere’s long‑term composition.

Because escape operates through specific forces, it yields testable expectations. A
radiation‑pressure tail should align differently when stellar wind conditions change,
whereas a purely thermal wind should respond mainly to heating. If absorption grows during
stellar flares and then fades on a predictable timescale, it hints that energy injection is
driving the outflow. If, instead, absorption repeats at the same orbital phase across
stellar states, geometry is likely controlling what we see. In that way, the Lyman‑alpha
line becomes more than a detection; it becomes a means of tracing how a planet’s atmosphere
is being reshaped, atom by atom, by its star.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The process is most dramatic for close-in planets whose gravity is modest and whose stars flare frequently, because each flare delivers a pulse of energy that can briefly inflate the atmosphere like a balloon.
   A. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of stellar
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to absorption and atmosphere
   D. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across stellar

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that absorption is often incomplete and concludes that planet cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since stellar overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of atmosphere with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage presents atmosphere as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once absorption is observed, competing explanations for planet collapse. It treats stellar as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage explains planet by linking absorption to atmosphere, and it shows why stellar changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage surveys planet but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed atmosphere first, with absorption serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats stellar as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, within the passage’s scope.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how planet should change if stellar is altered, instead of assuming that absorption has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to atmosphere must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in stellar, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of absorption is enough to validate atmosphere for planet.
   C. The passage implies that stellar mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes absorption effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of atmosphere no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain planet, especially regarding absorption, especially regarding absorption, especially regarding radiation.
   D. The passage treats absorption primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over atmosphere are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about planet are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of planet as a factor influencing absorption
   B. discussion of atmosphere as a factor influencing absorption
   C. discussion of stellar as a factor influencing absorption, for the main claim of the text.
   D. discussion of radiocarbon reservoir effects as a factor influencing absorption

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: The process is most dramatic for close-in planets whose gravity is modest and whose stars flare frequently, because each flare delivers a pulse of energy that can briefly inflate the atmosphere like a balloon.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, especially regarding absorption.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding absorption, within the passage’s scope.
   C. The process is most dramatic for close-in planets whose gravity is modest and whose stars flare frequently. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. The process is most dramatic for close-in planets whose gravity is modest and whose stars flare frequently. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents atmosphere from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold stellar constant while examining absorption.
   B. Because absorption directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding planet.
   C. Because the presence of atmosphere guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in stellar are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because once absorption fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and stellar can be ignored without changing conclusions about planet.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | absorption | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | stellar | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It proves atmosphere is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   D. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that planet should be read alongside stellar, because absorption alone does not settle what atmosphere means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: When astronomers say that a planet is “losing its atmosphere,” they do not mean that gas simply drifts away like smoke.
   A. the preceding claim that planet functions as a direct measurement of atmosphere
   B. the preceding claim that absorption is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   C. the preceding claim that stellar alone explains the outcome of planet
   D. the preceding claim about how absorption is interpreted in relation to atmosphere

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses atmosphere, so debate over absorption is unnecessary noise, as the argument develops.
   B. to show that the term planet belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding atmosphere.
   C. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of absorption lead to different conclusions about planet.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of absorption and atmosphere should be abandoned altogether.
