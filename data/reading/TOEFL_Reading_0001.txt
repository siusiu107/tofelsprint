Passage 0001: Lyman‑alpha Signatures of Exoplanet Atmospheric Escape (Astronomy)
================================================================================
(Word count: 688)

When astronomers say that a planet is “losing its atmosphere,” they do not mean that gas
simply drifts away like smoke. Escape, on the scale of a planet, begins with energy.
Ultraviolet radiation from a star heats the upper atmosphere, and if that heating is strong
enough, the highest layers expand until they are no longer bound tightly to the planet. The
process is most dramatic for close-in planets whose gravity is modest and whose stars flare
frequently, because each flare delivers a pulse of energy that can briefly inflate the
atmosphere like a balloon.

The most direct evidence for escape comes from hydrogen, the lightest element, which is
easier to lift out of a gravitational well than heavier molecules. During a transit,
hydrogen in the upper atmosphere can absorb starlight at the Lyman‑alpha wavelength,
producing an extra dip beyond what the planet’s solid body would cause. Yet a dip in
Lyman‑alpha is not a simple “hydrogen present” stamp. The line can be reshaped by the star’s
own activity, and it can be partly erased by interstellar hydrogen between the star and
Earth. Accordingly, the observer must read not only the depth of absorption but also its
timing: does it appear mainly during transit, or does it linger before and after, implying a
trailing tail of gas?

Two physical pictures compete for what that tail looks like. In a thermal picture, heating
drives a roughly symmetric outflow that accelerates as pressure falls with altitude,
producing a broad, slow wind. In a radiation‑pressure picture, stellar photons push hydrogen
atoms, so the escaping gas is swept into a comet‑like tail that can extend far behind the
planet. [A] If the tail is real, absorption should persist after the planet’s disk has
finished crossing the star, because the gas continues to block light even when the planet
itself no longer does. [B] If, instead, the line’s depth changes mainly with stellar
variability, the “tail” might be a mirage produced by a star whose emission fluctuates on
the same timescale as a transit. [C]

A case that forced astronomers to separate these explanations involved a hot Neptune
observed over several visits. In one visit, the Lyman‑alpha dip began slightly before the
optical transit and lasted long after, while in another visit, the early absorption vanished
but the late absorption remained. That asymmetry is hard to produce with a perfectly
symmetric thermal wind, because thermal expansion does not naturally create leading
absorption without some additional force. However, the same asymmetry is also difficult to
attribute to stellar flickering alone, since the late absorption repeated at nearly the same
orbital phase even when the star’s overall ultraviolet brightness differed. The result
pushed researchers toward a hybrid view in which thermal heating launches gas upward, while
radiation pressure and stellar wind shape where that gas travels.

Once gas escapes, it does not merely thin the upper atmosphere; it can change the planet’s
chemistry over time. If hydrogen is removed preferentially, heavier molecules become
relatively more abundant, and the mean molecular weight can rise, altering scale heights and
making future spectral features harder to detect. Furthermore, if the escaping wind
interacts with ionized particles from the star, it can form a bow shock that redirects
energy and influences where ions are created. [D] Thus, atmospheric escape is not a single
event but a continuing interaction between radiation, gravity, and plasma, one that can
sculpt the atmosphere’s long‑term composition.

Because escape operates through specific forces, it yields testable expectations. A
radiation‑pressure tail should align differently when stellar wind conditions change,
whereas a purely thermal wind should respond mainly to heating. If absorption grows during
stellar flares and then fades on a predictable timescale, it hints that energy injection is
driving the outflow. If, instead, absorption repeats at the same orbital phase across
stellar states, geometry is likely controlling what we see. In that way, the Lyman‑alpha
line becomes more than a detection; it becomes a means of tracing how a planet’s atmosphere
is being reshaped, atom by atom, by its star.

Questions
---------
1. [Inference] What can be inferred from the passage about absorption that persists after optical transit has ended?
   A. It can solely be consistent with a trailing cloud of escaping gas that continues to block starlight. This outcome would hold even if absorption stays constant.
   B. It can be consistent with a trailing cloud of escaping gas that continues to block starlight.
   C. It can be consistent with a trailing cloud of escaping gas that continues to block starlight by tying the effect to comet-like.
   D. It can be consistent with a leading cloud of escaping gas that continues to block starlight. This would occur only when comet-like dominates.

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention that interstellar hydrogen can erase part of the line?
   A. To show that a Lyman‑alpha dip must be interpreted cautiously rather than as a simple label by tying the effect to signatures.
   B. To show that a Lyman‑alpha dip must solely be interpreted cautiously rather than as a simple label. This would occur only when astronomy dominates.
   C. To show that a Lyman‑alpha dip must be interpreted cautiously rather than as a simple label.
   D. To show that a Lyman‑alpha dip must be interpreted cautiously rather than as a simple label. This would require exoplanet to be the limiting factor.

6. [Factual] According to the passage, why is hydrogen a common tracer of atmospheric escape?

   B. Because it is the lightest element and is easier to remove from a planet’s gravity by tying the effect to comet-like.
   C. Because it is the lightest element and is easier to remove from a planet’s gravity. That would make radiation-pressure the primary constraint.
   D. even though it is the lightest element and is easier to remove from a planet’s gravity. This would require astronomy to be the limiting factor.
