Passage 0381: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 785)

In replication efforts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: researchers
have treated increased liking for chosen options as the decisive sign of cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization. implicit association tests can make the
pattern look unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional
and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data
collection than about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. Using implicit
association tests under stable conditions, the argument reframes the issue so that one
frequently cited case from consumer choice studies appeared to support the direct-readout
view. Even though the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis
showed that small shifts in self-concept threat altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic
increased liking for chosen options. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic; this, in
turn, illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. The decisive factor is methodological humility; once
that is stated, the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A]
The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. If one
wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—increased liking
for chosen options—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. [B] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence. Whereas
popular summaries treat increased liking for chosen options as an endpoint in one account,
the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts in another. [C] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested.
[D] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that
manipulate or stratify self-concept threat, does one see why the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which implicit association
tests constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample; this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. Seldom, prior to
analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-site comparisons, did
investigators concede that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in which increased
liking for chosen options could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
self-concept threat often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes
whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, dissonance reduction after
decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Working
with sparse records and limited controls on self-concept threat, the key question becomes
whether many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization as
a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized increased liking for chosen
options as a signature invites a tidy story, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ forces boundary conditions to be stated. this
shift mattered for how evidence from consumer choice studies was generalized because, as the
author notes, local conditions can change which processes generate increased liking for
chosen options. Only after analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-
site comparisons did claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which increased liking for chosen options could be explained in
more than one way in part because confounders like self-concept threat often co-vary with
the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage
concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing
assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool
for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories
without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. longitudinal attitude surveys
   B. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   C. a list of Olympic medal counts
   D. shifted confidence judgments

2. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. it prevents devaluation of rejected alternatives from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control self-concept threat
   B. Since devaluation of rejected alternatives is observed in political opinion panels, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. Because devaluation of rejected alternatives appears, the mechanism must be unique, so self-concept threat can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once devaluation of rejected alternatives is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'dissonance reduction after decisions' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where implicit association tests constrains cultural norms about consistency
   C. The passage implies that workplace decision settings is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The discussion suggests that cultural norms about consistency is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

4. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when measurement reactivity can mimic devaluation of rejected alternatives.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using behavioral priming designs.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away measurement reactivity, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving behavioral priming designs.

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats choice-induced preference paradigms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifted confidence judgments or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using choice-induced preference paradigms are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting choice-induced preference paradigms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that shifted confidence judgments is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining choice-induced preference paradigms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
