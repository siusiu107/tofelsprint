Passage 0261: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 778)

When long geodetic records are examined, researchers found that researchers have treated
tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust
earthquakes and slow slip. Even if continuous GPS geodesy can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which helps explain why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. In replication attempts, it
becomes plausible that the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied
in settings unlike the Japan Trench region. the same summary statistic could be reproduced
while the underlying mechanisms differed because, as the author notes, fluid overpressure in
faults shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. So the author therefore
separates detection from interpretation, and so, too, does the evidence undermine treating
tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense,
megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the
passage presents as the lesson of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The argument
hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation. Were one wishes to move from
description to explanation to fail, then the same observation—tsunami-generating seafloor
uplift—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The
discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. Whereas popular
summaries treat tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as an endpoint may be convenient, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is
scientifically revealing. [C] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. [D] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead to
a different conclusion. Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify fluid
overpressure in faults was it clear that the debate became empirically productive rather
than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which continuous GPS geodesy constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why
the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. Only by analysts began combining continuous GPS geodesy
with cross-site comparisons was the field forced to accept that claims about subduction-zone
megathrust earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying
on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which tsunami-generating
seafloor uplift could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like
fluid overpressure in faults often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which
forces analysts to admit that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this
sense, episodic tremor and slip is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label. In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured
when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike the Japan Trench region. The passage
argues that the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms
differed because fluid overpressure in faults shifted the baseline in different directions
across sites. So the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, and so, too,
does the evidence undermine treating tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as a self-sufficient
conclusion. Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify fluid
overpressure in faults, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which continuous GPS geodesy
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample,
which helps explain why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny
the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this
sense, slow-slip events on plate interfaces is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label. In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that
the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into
the open. by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow
slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this,
in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any
story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage suggests that low-frequency tremor bursts is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when stress transfer after large events can mimic low-frequency tremor bursts.
   C. The author treats Sumatra–Andaman as a special case and argues that no broader inference about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip is possible.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving seafloor pressure sensors.

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **robust** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
   A. irrelevant to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip, serving only as background detail
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because stress transfer after large events dominates all evidence
   C. strong and reliable
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like numerical rupture simulations are needed

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats inversion of seismic waveforms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss foreshock clustering or stress transfer after large events. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because foreshock clustering uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that stress transfer after large events is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using inversion of seismic waveforms are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that foreshock clustering is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how stress transfer after large events can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Cascadia subduction zone. Finally, it maintains that tests combining inversion of seismic waveforms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   D. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like stress transfer after large events make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting inversion of seismic waveforms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: In replication attempts, it becomes plausible that the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike the Japan Trench region.
   A. transient surface deformation specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. fluid overpressure in faults alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. paleoseismic trenching as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

5. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that boundary conditions is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents foreshock clustering from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control fluid overpressure in faults
   B. Because fluid overpressure in faults co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. The passage implies that inversion of seismic waveforms directly measures causes, meaning confounding from fluid overpressure in faults is impossible.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if inversion of seismic waveforms produces a tight fit on one dataset.

   C. It proves tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is unique.
   D. It replaces seafloor pressure sensors with intuition.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The author argues that numerical rupture simulations should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The passage treats foreshock clustering as a confounder and fluid overpressure in faults as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The passage implies that the Chilean margin is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where numerical rupture simulations constrains fluid overpressure in faults

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Chilean margin and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates fluid overpressure in faults.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on continuous GPS geodesy simple.
