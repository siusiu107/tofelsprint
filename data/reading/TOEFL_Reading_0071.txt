Passage 0071: Mycorrhizae and the Hidden Phosphorus Economy
===========================================================
(Word count: 611)

In many forests, a seedling’s first problem is not sunlight, but phosphorus. Although
phosphorus is essential for DNA, membranes, and energy transfer, it moves slowly through
soil because it binds to minerals and organic particles. A young root that grows into a
patch of soil does not automatically “own” the phosphate there; it must compete with
neighboring plants and microbes for a nutrient that is chemically present yet biologically
hard to reach. For countless plant species, the solution is partnership.

Mycorrhizal fungi, whose name combines Greek words for “fungus” and “root,” form symbioses
in which fungal threads extend the effective reach of a plant’s roots. The fungal hyphae are
thinner than root hairs, so they can penetrate tiny pores that roots cannot enter. Because
they explore a larger volume of soil, they encounter more phosphate ions, and because their
chemistry can release enzymes and organic acids, they can free phosphorus from compounds
that would otherwise remain locked. In exchange, the plant supplies the fungus with
carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis. [A] This trade can look like a simple bargain, but
it has consequences that ripple through whole ecosystems.

Different mycorrhizal types shape the exchange differently. Arbuscular mycorrhizae, common
in grasses and many tropical trees, form microscopic “arbuscules” inside root cells,
creating a dense interface for nutrient transfer. Ectomycorrhizae, common in many temperate
and boreal trees, wrap roots in a sheath and send hyphae between root cells rather than into
them. The latter often produce enzymes that can access organic nitrogen and phosphorus,
which can matter in cool soils where decomposition is slow. Thus, the identity of the fungal
partner can shift what nutrients a plant can effectively exploit.

The partnership is also conditional. If soil phosphorus is plentiful, a plant may reduce its
investment in the fungus, because carbohydrates are not free. Conversely, in phosphorus-poor
soils, the same carbon payment can yield large returns. This is why experiments that add
fertilizer sometimes show a decline in mycorrhizal colonization: the plant’s cost–benefit
balance changes. Yet the balance is not only about nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi can improve
drought tolerance by increasing water uptake and can alter a plant’s vulnerability to
pathogens by occupying root space or by priming defense responses. [B] A fungus that is
nutritionally mediocre may still be valuable because it changes stress responses.

Because fungi connect multiple plants, mycorrhizae also complicate the idea of plants as
isolated competitors. Hyphae can link roots into networks through which carbon and nutrients
can move, sometimes from larger individuals to smaller ones. In seedling establishment, such
networks can function like an ecological “startup grant,” allowing shaded seedlings to
survive until a gap opens. However, networks can also transmit problems. Pathogens can
spread along shared root zones, and parasitic plants can tap into networks indirectly.
Moreover, not all fungi are equally generous. Some act more like brokers than helpers,
drawing carbon while providing limited nutrients. Plants, therefore, are not passive; they
can preferentially reward more cooperative fungi by allocating carbon to the most beneficial
connections.

The result is an underground economy whose currency is carbon and whose profits are measured
in growth. When mycorrhizal composition shifts—because of logging, fire, pollution, or
invasive species—plant communities can shift as well. Tree seedlings that depend on
ectomycorrhizae may fail if the fungal community is disrupted, while plants less reliant on
those partners may expand. [C] In that way, the forest’s visible structure can reflect an
invisible fungal infrastructure.

Mycorrhizae, then, are not decorative add-ons to roots. [D] They are causal agents that
change what plants can access, how they cope with stress, and which species can recruit into
the next generation.

Questions
---------
1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word “sheath” is closest in meaning to:
   A. a covering that surrounds and protects
   B. a chemical used to fertilize soils
   C. a type of mineral that binds phosphate
   D. a gap in the forest canopy


2. [Factual] According to the passage, how do mycorrhizal hyphae help plants obtain phosphorus?
   A. They explore soil pores roots cannot enter and can chemically help free phosphorus bound to particles.
   B. They explore soil pores roots cannot enter and can chemically help free partnership bound to particles. This outcome would hold even if plants stays constant.
   C. They explore soil pores roots cannot enter and must chemically help free phosphorus bound to particles. That would make mycorrhizae the primary constraint.
   D. They explore soil pores roots cannot enter and can solely chemically help free phosphorus bound to particles. This would require ectomycorrhizae to be the limiting factor.


3. [Inference] What can be inferred about why fertilization experiments may reduce mycorrhizal colonization?
   A. When phosphorus becomes abundant, the plant gains less from paying carbohydrates to the fungus.
   B. When phosphorus becomes abundant, the plant gains less from paying carbohydrates to the fungus. This would occur only when greek dominates.
   C. When phosphorus becomes abundant, the plant gains more from paying carbohydrates to the fungus. This would require sometimes to be the limiting factor.
   D. When phosphorus becomes abundant, the plant gains less from paying phosphate to the fungus. That would make economy the primary constraint.


4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?

   A. [A]

   B. altered vulnerability to pathogens.
   C. improved drought tolerance in this discussion.
   D. expanded access to phosphorus.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author contrast arbuscular and ectomycorrhizae?
   A. To show that different fungal partnerships must change which nutrients are accessed and how exchange occurs. That would make phosphate the primary constraint.

   C. To show that different fungal partnerships can solely change which nutrients are accessed and how exchange occurs. That would make phosphorus the primary constraint.

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the currency” refers to:
   A. carbon supplied by plants to fungi. This outcome would hold even if mycorrhizae stays constant.
   B. carbon supplied by plants to fungi. That would make add-ons the primary constraint.

   B. Some fungi must take carbon while providing relatively little nutritional benefit, so plants must manage the relationship. This would occur only when phosphorus dominates.
   C. Some fungi may solely take carbon while providing relatively little nutritional benefit, so plants must manage the relationship. This would require different to be the limiting factor.
   D. Some fungi may take carbon while providing relatively little nutritional benefit, so phosphate must manage the relationship. This would occur only when ectomycorrhizae dominates.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Mycorrhizal fungi form root partnerships that extend soil exploration and chemical access to phosphorus in exchange for plant carbon, with different mycorrhizal types offering different capabilities; because the relationship is conditional and must link plants into networks, changes in fungal communities can reshape seedling success and forest composition. That would make economy the primary constraint.
   B. Mycorrhizal fungi form root partnerships that extend soil exploration and chemical access to phosphorus in exchange for plant carbon, with responses mycorrhizal types offering different capabilities; because the relationship is conditional and can link plants into networks, changes in fungal communities can reshape seedling success and forest composition. This outcome would hold even if responses stays constant.
   C. Mycorrhizal fungi form root partnerships that extend soil exploration and chemical access to phosphorus in exchange for plant carbon, with different mycorrhizal types offering different capabilities; because the relationship is conditional and can link plants into networks, changes in fungal communities can reshape seedling success and forest composition.
   D. Mycorrhizal fungi form root partnerships that extend soil exploration and chemical access to phosphorus in exchange for plant carbon, with different mycorrhizal types offering different capabilities; even though the relationship is conditional and can link plants into networks, changes in fungal communities can reshape seedling success and forest composition. That would make carbohydrates the primary constraint.
