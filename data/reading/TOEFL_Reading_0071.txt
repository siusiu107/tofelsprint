Passage 0071: Mycorrhizae and the Hidden Phosphorus Economy
===========================================================
(Word count: 611)

In many forests, a seedling’s first problem is not sunlight, but phosphorus. Although
phosphorus is essential for DNA, membranes, and energy transfer, it moves slowly through
soil because it binds to minerals and organic particles. A young root that grows into a
patch of soil does not automatically “own” the phosphate there; it must compete with
neighboring plants and microbes for a nutrient that is chemically present yet biologically
hard to reach. For countless plant species, the solution is partnership.

Mycorrhizal fungi, whose name combines Greek words for “fungus” and “root,” form symbioses
in which fungal threads extend the effective reach of a plant’s roots. The fungal hyphae are
thinner than root hairs, so they can penetrate tiny pores that roots cannot enter. Because
they explore a larger volume of soil, they encounter more phosphate ions, and because their
chemistry can release enzymes and organic acids, they can free phosphorus from compounds
that would otherwise remain locked. In exchange, the plant supplies the fungus with
carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis. [A] This trade can look like a simple bargain, but
it has consequences that ripple through whole ecosystems.

Different mycorrhizal types shape the exchange differently. Arbuscular mycorrhizae, common
in grasses and many tropical trees, form microscopic “arbuscules” inside root cells,
creating a dense interface for nutrient transfer. Ectomycorrhizae, common in many temperate
and boreal trees, wrap roots in a sheath and send hyphae between root cells rather than into
them. The latter often produce enzymes that can access organic nitrogen and phosphorus,
which can matter in cool soils where decomposition is slow. Thus, the identity of the fungal
partner can shift what nutrients a plant can effectively exploit.

The partnership is also conditional. If soil phosphorus is plentiful, a plant may reduce its
investment in the fungus, because carbohydrates are not free. Conversely, in phosphorus-poor
soils, the same carbon payment can yield large returns. This is why experiments that add
fertilizer sometimes show a decline in mycorrhizal colonization: the plant’s cost–benefit
balance changes. Yet the balance is not only about nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi can improve
drought tolerance by increasing water uptake and can alter a plant’s vulnerability to
pathogens by occupying root space or by priming defense responses. [B] A fungus that is
nutritionally mediocre may still be valuable because it changes stress responses.

Because fungi connect multiple plants, mycorrhizae also complicate the idea of plants as
isolated competitors. Hyphae can link roots into networks through which carbon and nutrients
can move, sometimes from larger individuals to smaller ones. In seedling establishment, such
networks can function like an ecological “startup grant,” allowing shaded seedlings to
survive until a gap opens. However, networks can also transmit problems. Pathogens can
spread along shared root zones, and parasitic plants can tap into networks indirectly.
Moreover, not all fungi are equally generous. Some act more like brokers than helpers,
drawing carbon while providing limited nutrients. Plants, therefore, are not passive; they
can preferentially reward more cooperative fungi by allocating carbon to the most beneficial
connections.

The result is an underground economy whose currency is carbon and whose profits are measured
in growth. When mycorrhizal composition shifts—because of logging, fire, pollution, or
invasive species—plant communities can shift as well. Tree seedlings that depend on
ectomycorrhizae may fail if the fungal community is disrupted, while plants less reliant on
those partners may expand. [C] In that way, the forest’s visible structure can reflect an
invisible fungal infrastructure.

Mycorrhizae, then, are not decorative add-ons to roots. [D] They are causal agents that
change what plants can access, how they cope with stress, and which species can recruit into
the next generation.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: A young root that grows into a patch of soil does not automatically “own” the phosphate there; it must compete with neighboring plants and microbes for a nutrient that is chemically present yet biologically hard to reach.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across mycorrhizal
   B. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of mycorrhizal
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to plants and phosphorus

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that plants is often incomplete and concludes that plant cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since mycorrhizal overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of phosphorus with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, especially regarding plants.
   B. The passage presents phosphorus as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once plants is observed, competing explanations for plant collapse. It treats mycorrhizal as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage surveys plant but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed phosphorus first, with plants serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats mycorrhizal as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   D. The passage explains plant by linking plants to phosphorus, and it shows why mycorrhizal changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that mycorrhizal mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes plants effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of phosphorus no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain plant, as the discussion implies, as the discussion implies, especially regarding phosphorus.
   B. A persuasive account would predict how plant should change if mycorrhizal is altered, instead of assuming that plants has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to phosphorus must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   C. The passage treats plants primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over phosphorus are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about plant are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in mycorrhizal, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of plants is enough to validate phosphorus for plant.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of archival bias as a factor influencing plants
   B. discussion of mycorrhizal as a factor influencing plants
   C. discussion of phosphorus as a factor influencing plants
   D. discussion of plant as a factor influencing plants, especially regarding fungal.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: A young root that grows into a patch of soil does not automatically “own” the phosphate there; it must compete with neighboring plants and microbes for a nutrient that is chemically present yet biologically hard to reach.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence, especially regarding phosphorus.
   B. A young root that grows into a patch of soil does not automatically “own” the phosphate there. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, under the stated assumptions, especially regarding plants.
   D. A young root that grows into a patch of soil does not automatically “own” the phosphate there. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because plants directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding plant.
   B. Because comparability prevents phosphorus from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold mycorrhizal constant while examining plants.
   C. Because the presence of phosphorus guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in mycorrhizal are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because once plants fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and mycorrhizal can be ignored without changing conclusions about plant.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | plants | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | mycorrhizal | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves phosphorus is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that plant should be read alongside mycorrhizal, because plants alone does not settle what phosphorus means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This trade can look like a simple bargain, but it has consequences that ripple through whole ecosystems.
   A. the idea that Because they explore a larger volume of soil, they encounter more phosphate ions, and because their chemistry can release enzymes and organic acids, they...
   B. the idea that In exchange, the plant supplies the fungus with carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis
   C. the idea that Different mycorrhizal types shape the exchange differently, as the discussion implies, as the discussion implies.
   D. the idea that Yet the balance is not only about nutrients, in the context of the passage, for the phenomenon at issue.
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term plant belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of plants lead to different conclusions about plant.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses phosphorus, so debate over plants is unnecessary noise, as the argument develops.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of plants and phosphorus should be abandoned altogether, especially regarding plant.
