Passage 0071: Mycorrhizae and the Hidden Phosphorus Economy
===========================================================
(Word count: 611)

In many forests, a seedling’s first problem is not sunlight, but phosphorus. Although
phosphorus is essential for DNA, membranes, and energy transfer, it moves slowly through
soil because it binds to minerals and organic particles. A young root that grows into a
patch of soil does not automatically “own” the phosphate there; it must compete with
neighboring plants and microbes for a nutrient that is chemically present yet biologically
hard to reach. For countless plant species, the solution is partnership.

Mycorrhizal fungi, whose name combines Greek words for “fungus” and “root,” form symbioses
in which fungal threads extend the effective reach of a plant’s roots. The fungal hyphae are
thinner than root hairs, so they can penetrate tiny pores that roots cannot enter. Because
they explore a larger volume of soil, they encounter more phosphate ions, and because their
chemistry can release enzymes and organic acids, they can free phosphorus from compounds
that would otherwise remain locked. In exchange, the plant supplies the fungus with
carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis. [A] This trade can look like a simple bargain, but
it has consequences that ripple through whole ecosystems.

Different mycorrhizal types shape the exchange differently. Arbuscular mycorrhizae, common
in grasses and many tropical trees, form microscopic “arbuscules” inside root cells,
creating a dense interface for nutrient transfer. Ectomycorrhizae, common in many temperate
and boreal trees, wrap roots in a sheath and send hyphae between root cells rather than into
them. The latter often produce enzymes that can access organic nitrogen and phosphorus,
which can matter in cool soils where decomposition is slow. Thus, the identity of the fungal
partner can shift what nutrients a plant can effectively exploit.

The partnership is also conditional. If soil phosphorus is plentiful, a plant may reduce its
investment in the fungus, because carbohydrates are not free. Conversely, in phosphorus-poor
soils, the same carbon payment can yield large returns. This is why experiments that add
fertilizer sometimes show a decline in mycorrhizal colonization: the plant’s cost–benefit
balance changes. Yet the balance is not only about nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi can improve
drought tolerance by increasing water uptake and can alter a plant’s vulnerability to
pathogens by occupying root space or by priming defense responses. [B] A fungus that is
nutritionally mediocre may still be valuable because it changes stress responses.

Because fungi connect multiple plants, mycorrhizae also complicate the idea of plants as
isolated competitors. Hyphae can link roots into networks through which carbon and nutrients
can move, sometimes from larger individuals to smaller ones. In seedling establishment, such
networks can function like an ecological “startup grant,” allowing shaded seedlings to
survive until a gap opens. However, networks can also transmit problems. Pathogens can
spread along shared root zones, and parasitic plants can tap into networks indirectly.
Moreover, not all fungi are equally generous. Some act more like brokers than helpers,
drawing carbon while providing limited nutrients. Plants, therefore, are not passive; they
can preferentially reward more cooperative fungi by allocating carbon to the most beneficial
connections.

The result is an underground economy whose currency is carbon and whose profits are measured
in growth. When mycorrhizal composition shifts—because of logging, fire, pollution, or
invasive species—plant communities can shift as well. Tree seedlings that depend on
ectomycorrhizae may fail if the fungal community is disrupted, while plants less reliant on
those partners may expand. [C] In that way, the forest’s visible structure can reflect an
invisible fungal infrastructure.

Mycorrhizae, then, are not decorative add-ons to roots. [D] They are causal agents that
change what plants can access, how they cope with stress, and which species can recruit into
the next generation.


Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word “sheath” is closest in meaning to:
   A. a covering that surrounds and protects
   B. a type of mineral that binds phosphate
   C. a chemical used to fertilize soils
   D. a gap in the forest canopy

2. [Factual] According to the passage, how do mycorrhizal hyphae help plants obtain phosphorus?
   A. They explore soil pores roots cannot enter and can chemically help free phosphorus bound to particles
   B. They manufacture phosphorus directly from carbon dioxide
   C. They prevent phosphorus from binding to minerals by cooling the soil
   D. They replace roots entirely so plants no longer need soil

3. [Inference] What can be inferred about why fertilization experiments may reduce mycorrhizal colonization?
   A. When phosphorus becomes abundant, the plant gains less from paying carbohydrates to the fungus
   B. Fertilizer kills all fungi by raising soil salinity to lethal levels
   C. Plants stop photosynthesizing when nutrients increase
   D. Fungi refuse to associate with plants in any temperate forest

4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the fungal threads operate at a different scale from roots, they can turn a chemically scarce nutrient into a practical one.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following benefits of mycorrhizae are mentioned EXCEPT:
   A. improved drought tolerance
   B. altered vulnerability to pathogens
   C. expanded access to phosphorus
   D. direct production of oxygen for roots

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author contrast arbuscular and ectomycorrhizae?
   A. To show that different fungal partnerships can change which nutrients are accessed and how exchange occurs
   B. To argue that only one type of mycorrhiza exists worldwide
   C. To claim that grasses never form symbioses
   D. To explain why phosphate binds to minerals

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the currency” refers to:
   A. carbon supplied by plants to fungi
   B. phosphate minerals in soil
   C. sunlight captured by leaves
   D. water stored in hyphae

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces a nutrient limitation, explains the fungal partnership mechanism, distinguishes mycorrhizal types, discusses conditional costs and network effects, and ends with ecosystem consequences
   B. It presents a chronology of every fungal species discovered
   C. It focuses only on photosynthesis and ignores soils
   D. It argues that plants do not compete for nutrients

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that fungi can act like “brokers”?
   A. Some fungi may take carbon while providing relatively little nutritional benefit, so plants must manage the relationship
   B. Fungi sell phosphate on markets using money
   C. Brokers refers to insects that pollinate fungi
   D. Fungi prevent any nutrient exchange from occurring

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Mycorrhizae are cosmetic growths that appear only when soils are rich in phosphorus.
   B. Mycorrhizal fungi form root partnerships that extend soil exploration and chemical access to phosphorus in exchange for plant carbon, with different mycorrhizal types offering different capabilities; because the relationship is conditional and can link plants into networks, changes in fungal communities can reshape seedling success and forest composition.
   C. Plants obtain phosphorus primarily by manufacturing it from sugars.
   D. Fertilizers always increase mycorrhizal colonization because plants reward fungi for extra nutrients.
