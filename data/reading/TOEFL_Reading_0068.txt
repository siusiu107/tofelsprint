Passage 0068: Antibiotic Stewardship and the Evolutionary Arithmetic of Resistance (Medicine/Microbiology)
==========================================================================================================
(Word count: 603)

Antibiotics are among the most powerful tools in medicine, yet their power is undermined by
the evolutionary logic of resistance. When an antibiotic is used, susceptible bacteria are
inhibited or killed, while rare variants with protective mutations or acquired resistance
genes survive and multiply. Over time, the drug that once worked reliably becomes less
effective, and infections that were routine become dangerous. Antibiotic stewardship—the
coordinated effort to use antibiotics wisely—emerged as a response to this predictable, yet
still alarming, outcome.

Stewardship begins with the recognition that “more” is not always better. Broad-spectrum
antibiotics can cover many organisms, which is useful when a clinician does not yet know
what pathogen is responsible. Yet broad coverage also applies selective pressure to a wide
swath of bacteria, including harmless commensals in the gut. Those commensals can become a
reservoir of resistance genes that later transfer to pathogens. Moreover, disrupting the
microbiome can allow opportunistic infections such as Clostridioides difficile to flourish,
producing severe diarrhea and colitis. [A] Thus, an antibiotic can cure one problem while
creating ecological openings for another.

A central stewardship strategy is de-escalation. A patient with suspected sepsis may receive
empiric broad-spectrum therapy immediately, because delay can be lethal; however, once
cultures and sensitivities return, clinicians can narrow therapy to a more targeted drug or
stop antibiotics if infection is not confirmed. This requires infrastructure: timely lab
processing, clear communication, and decision support. Rapid diagnostic tests—PCR panels,
mass spectrometry identification, and biomarkers such as procalcitonin—can shorten
uncertainty windows, making narrowing decisions easier. [B] The faster uncertainty
collapses, the less time broad selection pressures operate.

Duration is another leverage point. For many infections, evidence now supports shorter
courses than were historically common. A shorter course can reduce selection pressure and
adverse effects without compromising cure, but clinicians and patients can be uneasy,
interpreting “shorter” as “riskier.” Stewardship programs therefore combine guidelines with
feedback and education, showing local outcome data and emphasizing that unnecessary days of
antibiotics are not neutral; they are evolutionary training sessions for bacteria.

Hospitals often implement stewardship through teams that review prescriptions, offer
recommendations, and track resistance patterns. In some settings, certain high-risk
antibiotics require approval from an infectious disease specialist, or automatic stop orders
trigger reassessment. Such measures can reduce inappropriate prescribing, yet they must be
designed carefully to avoid delaying life-saving therapy. Stewardship is therefore not a
simple restriction; it is an attempt to align speed with precision—treat early, then adjust
quickly.

Resistance also spreads beyond hospitals. Antibiotics used in outpatient clinics, dentistry,
and agriculture contribute to the overall selective environment. International travel moves
resistant strains across borders. Wastewater can contain antibiotic residues and resistant
bacteria, linking human practice to environmental microbiology. The problem is thus
distributed, which is why stewardship is framed as a collective responsibility rather than
as an individual virtue.

Ultimately, stewardship asks medicine to think ecologically. [C] It treats antibiotics as
shared resources whose effectiveness depends on restraint and on rapid learning. [D] When
clinicians prescribe with an eye to both the patient in front of them and the microbial
population that will exist next month, they practice a form of care that is simultaneously
immediate and intergenerational.

Stewardship teams often rely on rapid diagnostics precisely because delay encourages
empirical broad-spectrum prescribing that later proves unnecessary.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] What can be inferred about why broad-spectrum antibiotics can increase future resistance even when they help the current patient?
   A. They apply selection pressure to many bacteria, including commensals that can become reservoirs of resistance genes
   B. They permanently eliminate all bacteria, preventing evolution
   C. They improve the microbiome’s diversity so resistance cannot spread
   D. They work only against viruses, forcing bacteria to mutate

2. [Factual] According to the passage, what is “de-escalation” in antibiotic use?
   A. Narrowing or stopping therapy once culture or diagnostic information reduces uncertainty
   B. Using the strongest antibiotic for the longest possible time
   C. Avoiding any antibiotics even in suspected sepsis
   D. Replacing antibiotics with vaccines after symptoms resolve

3. [Vocabulary] The word “reservoir” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a source or store from which something can spread
   B. a hospital intensive care unit
   C. a laboratory culture dish
   D. a chemical buffer that stores oxygen

4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In that sense, stewardship is as much about managing uncertainty as it is about choosing drugs.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as contexts contributing to resistance EXCEPT:
   A. outpatient clinics and dentistry
   B. agriculture and travel
   C. wastewater containing residues
   D. mining and processing lapis lazuli for pigment

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author mention Clostridioides difficile in the context of antibiotics?
   A. To provide an example of how microbiome disruption can create opportunities for harmful infections
   B. To argue that C. difficile is cured only by longer antibiotic courses
   C. To show that antibiotics do not affect gut bacteria
   D. To claim that all diarrhea is viral and unrelated to antibiotics

7. [Reference] In the passage, “such measures” refers to:
   A. hospital stewardship interventions like review teams, approvals, and stop orders
   B. using oxygen-storage materials to buffer exhaust
   C. auditory stimulation to enhance sleep rhythms
   D. removing sea urchins from kelp forests

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces resistance logic, explains why broad-spectrum use has costs, then presents stewardship tools such as de-escalation, rapid diagnostics, and shorter durations, before expanding to system-wide spread and concluding with an ecological framing
   B. It lists antibiotics alphabetically with no discussion of use
   C. It argues that resistance can be solved solely by inventing new drugs
   D. It focuses on hospital architecture rather than prescribing

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that antibiotics are “shared resources”?
   A. Because resistance affects future patients, preserving antibiotic effectiveness requires collective restraint and wise use today
   B. Antibiotics are physically stored in public warehouses for anyone to take
   C. Shared resources means every antibiotic treats every infection equally
   D. Resistance is individual and cannot spread, so sharing is irrelevant

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Antibiotic stewardship argues that clinicians should delay treatment until every test is complete.
   B. The passage explains antibiotic stewardship as an effort to slow resistance by reducing unnecessary broad selection pressure through strategies such as rapid diagnostics, de-escalation, and shorter durations, while acknowledging the need for timely treatment and the wider spread of resistance beyond hospitals, framing antibiotics as resources managed best with ecological awareness.
   C. Resistance arises only from agricultural use, so hospital stewardship is unnecessary.
   D. Broad-spectrum antibiotics never disrupt the microbiome, so concerns about C. difficile are misplaced.
