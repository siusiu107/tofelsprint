Passage 0721: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 743)

Despite the appeal of a single mechanism, one sees why researchers have treated low-
frequency tremor bursts as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and
slow slip. While it is true that numerical rupture simulations can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from description to
explanation to fail, then the same observation—low-frequency tremor bursts—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries
treat low-frequency tremor bursts as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it
as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder to
interpret without assumptions. In this sense, megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated as
a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify fluid overpressure in
faults could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which numerical rupture simulations constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps
explain why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking
examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify fluid overpressure in faults
did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which numerical rupture simulations constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be dramatic, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, episodic tremor and slip is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely has it been the case that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and
slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions,
at least before analysts began combining numerical rupture simulations with cross-site
comparisons. the goal was to break degeneracies in which low-frequency tremor bursts could
be explained in more than one way largely because confounders like fluid overpressure in
faults often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became
an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move that changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable.

In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike the Cascadia
subduction zone. [A] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead to
a different conclusion. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying
mechanisms differed because, as the author notes, fluid overpressure in faults shifted the
baseline in different directions across sites. [B] The passage highlights that mechanism
claims must survive out-of-sample checks. the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation, not because treating low-frequency tremor bursts as a self-sufficient
conclusion, but because the assumptions differ. [C] The passage emphasizes boundary
conditions instead of treating them as afterthoughts. [D] The author suggests that the same
evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ. In this sense, slow-slip events on
plate interfaces is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; still, the result is a
framework in which low-frequency tremor bursts is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the inference is underdetermined, the most informative tests are those that break degeneracies rather than those that merely sharpen one feature.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: While it is true that numerical rupture simulations can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions.

   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. heterogeneous frictional properties alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. seafloor pressure sensors as a device rather than as an analytic approach

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where inversion of seismic waveforms constrains heterogeneous frictional properties
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'episodic tremor and slip' refers to a different field altogether, not to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip.
   C. The passage treats tsunami-generating seafloor uplift as a confounder and heterogeneous frictional properties as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The author argues that inversion of seismic waveforms should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. seafloor pressure sensors
   B. Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip
   C. the length of the Nile in miles
   D. tsunami-generating seafloor uplift

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on numerical rupture simulations simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates heterogeneous frictional properties.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Japan Trench region and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies one mechanism.

6. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats Sumatra–Andaman as a special case and argues that no broader inference about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip is possible.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using continuous GPS geodesy.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when stress transfer after large events can mimic foreshock clustering.
   D. The passage suggests that foreshock clustering is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | seafloor pressure sensors | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | transient surface deformation | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | fluid overpressure in faults | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices
   B. Depends on modeling priors
   C. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   D. It proves tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is unique.

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that instrument calibration is important mainly because:
   A. Since transient surface deformation is observed in Sumatra–Andaman, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if continuous GPS geodesy produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. it prevents transient surface deformation from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control fluid overpressure in faults
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once transient surface deformation is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that locked versus creeping patches is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using seafloor pressure sensors are unnecessary.
   B. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that low-frequency tremor bursts is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how locked versus creeping patches can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Japan Trench region. Finally, it maintains that tests combining seafloor pressure sensors with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   C. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like locked versus creeping patches make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting seafloor pressure sensors as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats seafloor pressure sensors as a historical curiosity and does not discuss low-frequency tremor bursts or locked versus creeping patches. It ends without any methodological implication.

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **conspicuous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify fluid overpressure in faults did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because fluid overpressure in faults dominates all evidence
   B. easy to notice
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like numerical rupture simulations are needed
   D. irrelevant to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip, serving only as background detail
