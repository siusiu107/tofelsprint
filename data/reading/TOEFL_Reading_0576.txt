Passage 0576: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 716)

In operando measurement campaigns, researchers have treated poisoning by CO as the decisive
sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. in situ spectroscopy can make the
pattern look unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional
and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data
collection than about what the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, it becomes plausible that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike automotive catalytic converters. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely
because support interactions shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. The
issue is not treating poisoning by CO as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author
therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense, surface-mediated catalysis
on pt is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Never before analysts began combining in situ spectroscopy with cross-site comparisons was
it defensible to argue that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which poisoning by CO could be explained in more than one way
because, as the author notes, confounders like support interactions often co-vary with the
driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than
a stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify support interactions occurred
when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which in situ spectroscopy constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Even if a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In
this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. [A] The author suggests that the same evidence can
support multiple stories when priors differ. Unless one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—poisoning by CO—must be paired with tests that change
the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence. [B] The author
shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. Whereas
popular summaries treat poisoning by CO as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it
as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes more
predictive under replication. [C] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts
as evidence. [D] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be
discarded.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify support interactions,
did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which in situ spectroscopy constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even if a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Though the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which poisoning by CO is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than
through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **attenuated** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.
   A. weakened
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like temperature-programmed desorption are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because catalyst deactivation dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces, serving only as background detail

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. The passage implies that industrial hydrogenation reactors is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The passage treats selectivity shifts as a confounder and catalyst deactivation as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where temperature-programmed desorption constrains catalyst deactivation
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'metal-surface catalytic conversion' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on microkinetic modeling simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in automotive catalytic converters and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates adsorbate coverage effects.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selectivity shifts uniquely identifies one mechanism.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | temperature-programmed desorption | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | rate enhancement | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | adsorbate coverage effects | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces temperature-programmed desorption with intuition.
   B. May be muted by other processes
   C. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   D. Can introduce systematic bias

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when support interactions can mimic selectivity shifts.
   B. The author treats electrochemical interfaces as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving temperature-programmed desorption.
   D. The passage suggests that selectivity shifts is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that model assumptions is important mainly because:
   A. Because catalyst deactivation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. Because structure-sensitive activity appears, the mechanism must be unique, so catalyst deactivation can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. it prevents structure-sensitive activity from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control catalyst deactivation
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once structure-sensitive activity is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. poisoning by CO
   B. a recipe for bread fermentation
   C. temperature-programmed desorption
   D. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because structure-sensitive activity uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that adsorbate coverage effects is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using DFT surface modeling are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats DFT surface modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss structure-sensitive activity or adsorbate coverage effects. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like adsorbate coverage effects make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting DFT surface modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that structure-sensitive activity is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how adsorbate coverage effects can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from laboratory single-crystal studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining DFT surface modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.

9. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

10. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:

   A. adsorbate coverage effects alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. in situ spectroscopy as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. structure-sensitive activity specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
