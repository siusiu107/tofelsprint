Passage 0957: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 754)

Against that intuitive story, researchers found that researchers have treated disparate
exposure to pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Admittedly, mobility tracking with administrative records can make
the pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is
conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about
data collection than about what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from
historical redlining could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which mobility tracking with
administrative records constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In
this sense, spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation holds, then the same observation—disparate exposure to
pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from
historical redlining did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate
became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which
mobility tracking with administrative records constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. To be sure, a single case can be
dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality across
neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike post-industrial cities. [A] The passage returns to
this point to clarify what counts as evidence. the same summary statistic could be
reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because, as the author notes, path
dependence from historical redlining shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. [B] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism.
So the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, and so, too, does the
evidence undermine treating disparate exposure to pollution as a self-sufficient conclusion.
[C] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. [D] The
author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance.

Not until analysts began combining mobility tracking with administrative records with cross-
site comparisons was it clear that claims about residential segregation and the persistence
of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate exposure to
pollution could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like path
dependence from historical redlining often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in
turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, persistent
neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool
for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without
implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a
definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which disparate exposure to
pollution is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. The author argues that spatial autocorrelation analysis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'persistent neighborhood-level disparities' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   C. The passage treats school-quality gradients as a confounder and path dependence from historical redlining as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where spatial autocorrelation analysis constrains path dependence from historical redlining

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   B. the price of coal in 1700
   C. mobility constraints across space
   D. longitudinal panel data

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: If one wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the same observation—disparate exposure to pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. mobility constraints across space specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. informational asymmetries in housing search alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. spatial autocorrelation analysis as a device rather than as an analytic approach

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage suggests that wealth accumulation gaps is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using mobility tracking with administrative records.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving mobility tracking with administrative records.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when zoning rules and land-use regulation can mimic wealth accumulation gaps.

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | spatial autocorrelation analysis | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | wealth accumulation gaps | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | credit market discrimination | Changes the apparent slope |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. It replaces longitudinal panel data with intuition.
   B. Changes the apparent slope
   C. It proves school-quality gradients is unique.
   D. It makes path dependence from historical redlining irrelevant.

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that zoning rules and land-use regulation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using spatial autocorrelation analysis are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats spatial autocorrelation analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or zoning rules and land-use regulation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how zoning rules and land-use regulation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from post-industrial cities. Finally, it maintains that tests combining spatial autocorrelation analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   D. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like zoning rules and land-use regulation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting spatial autocorrelation analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates informational asymmetries in housing search.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in European migrant neighborhoods and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on spatial autocorrelation analysis simple.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies one mechanism.

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the inference is underdetermined, the most informative tests are those that break degeneracies rather than those that merely sharpen one feature.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. The passage implies that quasi-experimental policy evaluation directly measures causes, meaning confounding from credit market discrimination is impossible.
   B. it prevents school-quality gradients from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control credit market discrimination
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if quasi-experimental policy evaluation produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once school-quality gradients is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **sparse** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.
   A. thinly spread
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because credit market discrimination dominates all evidence
   C. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like quasi-experimental policy evaluation are needed
