Passage 0096: Catalytic Converters and the Chemistry of Cleaner Exhaust (Chemical Engineering)
==============================================================================================
(Word count: 606)

A modern car is, in chemical terms, a moving reactor whose byproducts must be managed.
Gasoline combustion ideally yields carbon dioxide and water, yet real engines produce carbon
monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants harm health and
contribute to smog. The catalytic converter, installed in the exhaust system, is designed to
transform those molecules into less harmful forms before they leave the tailpipe.

The core of a converter is a ceramic or metallic substrate shaped like a honeycomb. Its many
channels maximize surface area while allowing gas to flow. The substrate is coated with a
“washcoat,” often alumina, that holds precious-metal catalysts such as platinum, palladium,
and rhodium. [A] As hot exhaust passes over these surfaces, molecules adsorb, react, and
desorb, so that chemistry occurs without the catalyst being consumed.

A three-way catalytic converter performs three tasks when the engine operates near
stoichiometric air–fuel ratios. First, it oxidizes carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide.
Second, it oxidizes unburned hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water. Third, it reduces
nitrogen oxides to nitrogen. These reactions compete for oxygen, which is why oxygen sensing
and engine control are integral to the system. If the mixture is too lean, excess oxygen
hinders NOx reduction; if too rich, oxidation reactions slow. To buffer fluctuations,
converters often use cerium oxide in the washcoat, which can store and release oxygen by
shifting between oxidation states. [B] The buffer does not eliminate the need for control,
but it widens the window in which all three reactions can proceed.

Converter performance is sensitive to temperature. Below a certain “light-off” temperature,
reactions are too slow, and emissions pass through untreated; after light-off, efficiency
rises sharply. Cold starts are therefore critical emission moments, which is why some
designs place catalysts closer to the engine or use electrically heated catalysts.
Overheating, however, can sinter catalyst particles, reducing active surface area, and
contaminants such as sulfur or lead can poison catalysts by occupying sites. Thus,
durability depends on both materials and fuel quality.

Regulation has pushed converters to improve, yet improvement is constrained by cost and
supply. Precious metals are expensive, and their markets can be volatile. Engineers
therefore seek formulations that use less metal while maintaining activity, and they tailor
catalyst distributions along the converter length to match concentration gradients of
pollutants. Meanwhile, diagnostics monitor converter function, because a failing catalyst
can quietly raise emissions. [C] The device is expected to work invisibly, which means its
failure is often noticed only by sensors and regulations, not by drivers.

Catalytic converters demonstrate how environmental policy can become embodied in material
design. [D] They are chemical factories in miniature, relying on surfaces, oxygen
management, and temperature to convert the chaos of combustion into a cleaner exhaust
stream.

In practice, engineers balance efficiency against cost, because a catalyst that is perfect
in the lab may be fragile on the road.

A well-functioning system is therefore not only a material but also a set of maintenance
expectations embedded in policy and behavior.

   A. to bind to a surface so that a reaction can
   B. to confuse the reader with unrelated details
   C. to store objects in a warehouse
   D. to reverse a decision completely


3. [Factual] According to the passage, which statement is supported?
   A. catalytic converter plays a central role in the process described, interacting with nitrogen oxides rather than acting alone. This outcome would hold even if maintenance stays constant.
   B. catalytic converter plays a central role in the process described, interacting with nitrogen oxides rather than acting alone.
   C. catalytic converter plays a central role in the process described, interacting with nitrogen oxides rather than acting alone. That would make cleaner the primary constraint.
   D. catalytic three-way plays a central role in the process described, interacting with nitrogen oxides rather than acting alone. This would require below to be the limiting factor.
