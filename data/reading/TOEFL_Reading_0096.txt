Passage 0096: Weimar Hyperinflation and How Expectations Accelerate Currency Collapse (Economic History)
========================================================================================================
(Word count: 614)

Hyperinflation is often remembered through photographs: children stacking banknotes like
toys, workers paid twice a day, prices written in chalk and then crossed out an hour later.
Germany’s hyperinflation of 1921–1923, which culminated in a catastrophic collapse of the
mark, did not arise from one reckless decision. It emerged from a chain of fiscal stress,
political constraint, and monetary responses that fed back on expectations until the
currency lost its role as a stable unit of account.

After World War I, the German state faced heavy costs: demobilization, social programs to
ease unrest, and, crucially, reparations payments demanded by the Allies. Tax revenues were
insufficient, and political willingness to raise taxes sharply was limited. The government
therefore financed deficits partly by borrowing and partly by relying on the Reichsbank to
expand the money supply. [A] As more marks were created, the purchasing power of each mark
tended to fall, particularly when goods were scarce and when international confidence was
fragile.

Reparations complicated the exchange rate. Because payments had to be made in foreign
currency or in goods, the government needed foreign exchange. When the mark depreciated,
importing became more expensive, which raised domestic prices for imported inputs and food,
and those higher prices fed into wage demands. A spiral began: workers sought higher nominal
wages; firms raised prices to cover wages; and the state printed more money to meet
obligations. The public, observing the pace of depreciation, tried to spend marks quickly on
anything tangible, increasing velocity and amplifying price rises. [B] Money became
something to get rid of rather than to hold.

The crisis accelerated in 1923 when French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr after
Germany fell behind on payments. The German government responded with “passive resistance,”
encouraging workers to strike and promising to pay their wages anyway. Financing that policy
required yet more printing, while industrial output fell, shrinking the real goods
available. The imbalance between money and goods widened dramatically. In such a context,
even a modest additional shock could trigger a disproportionate price jump, because
expectations had already shifted: merchants set prices anticipating tomorrow’s depreciation,
not today’s costs.

Stabilization came through a mixture of institutional change and credibility. The government
introduced the Rentenmark, a new unit backed not by gold but by claims on industrial and
agricultural assets, and it limited issuance sharply. Fiscal reforms improved tax
collection, and the end of passive resistance reduced the need for emergency financing.
International negotiations, including the Dawes Plan, restructured reparations and
facilitated loans, easing foreign exchange pressure. [C] Crucially, people came to believe
that the new regime would not print without limit, and that belief itself reduced the rush
to spend.

The episode illustrates that hyperinflation is as much about confidence as about arithmetic.
Printing money in a stable state can raise prices, but it does not automatically destroy a
currency. Destruction occurs when people expect continued loss and act accordingly, turning
expectation into behavior and behavior into accelerated depreciation. [D] Germany’s case,
though extreme, therefore remains a warning about how quickly the social function of money
can unravel when fiscal strain and political constraint collide.

   A. the Ruhr occupation and Germany’s policy of paying for passive resistance
   B. the opening of new gold mines in Bavaria
   C. a sudden discovery of exoplanet water vapor

   B. [B]
   C. [C]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why introducing the Rentenmark helped stabilize prices?
   A. It changed expectations by credibly limiting issuance and signaling a new monetary regime that would not print without bound
   B. It immediately increased the supply of consumer goods in the Ruhr

   D. It worked only because foreign currencies were outlawed

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author say money became “something to get rid of”?
   A. To illustrate how expected depreciation increased spending speed, which further accelerated price increases
   B. To argue that banknotes physically decayed in humid air
   C. To claim that coins were outlawed by the Allies
   D. To suggest that workers refused wages as a moral protest

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as contributors to stabilization EXCEPT:
   A. limiting issuance of the new currency
   B. improved tax collection
   C. international reparations restructuring and loans
   D. honeybee royal jelly feeding schedules

7. [Reference] In the passage, “a chain of fiscal stress, political constraint, and monetary responses” refers to:
   A. interacting pressures that led deficits to be financed by money creation and expectations to spiral
   B. a navigation method combining stars and swells
   C. a chemical sequence converting plaster to pigment
   D. the exchange of plasmids between bacteria

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It explains postwar fiscal pressures, describes feedbacks that accelerated inflation, then details the 1923 Ruhr shock and concludes with the institutional and credibility-based steps that stabilized the currency
   B. It lists banknote denominations without discussing causes
   C. It argues that hyperinflation is caused only by greed
   D. It compares Germany’s case to fresco restoration techniques

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the passage’s lesson about hyperinflation?
   A. Currency collapse occurs when fiscal strain and money creation shift expectations so that people spend rapidly, accelerating depreciation
   B. Any increase in money supply automatically produces hyperinflation in all countries
   C. Hyperinflation is primarily a consequence of volcanic eruptions
   D. Stabilization requires only printing even more money

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage claims German hyperinflation was caused solely by counterfeiters and could not be stopped.
   B. The passage describes Weimar Germany’s hyperinflation as an escalating interaction of postwar fiscal burdens, reparations pressures, political limits on taxation, and money creation that shifted public expectations and spending behavior; it highlights the Ruhr occupation and passive resistance as accelerants and explains stabilization through the Rentenmark, fiscal reforms, and restored credibility supported by international restructuring.
   C. The passage argues that exchange rates played no role because Germany was economically isolated.
   D. Stabilization is said to have occurred when workers refused to accept any wages at all.
