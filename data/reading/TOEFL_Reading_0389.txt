Passage 0389: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 638)

From a cognitive-control perspective, the passage argues that researchers have treated
shifted confidence judgments as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. Despite the fact that longitudinal attitude surveys can make the pattern
look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] This becomes a pivot point
where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation holds, then the same observation—shifted confidence judgments—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The passage signals that a
tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. Whereas popular summaries treat shifted
confidence judgments as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts. [C] The passage returns to this point to clarify
what counts as evidence. [D] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Never before analysts began combining longitudinal attitude surveys with cross-site
comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which shifted confidence
judgments could be explained in more than one way because confounders like cultural norms
about consistency often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike consumer choice studies. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed in part because
cultural norms about consistency shifted the baseline in different directions across sites.
So the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, and so, too, does the
evidence undermine treating shifted confidence judgments as a self-sufficient conclusion. In
this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural
norms about consistency. by comparing cases in which longitudinal attitude surveys
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample,
which forces analysts to admit that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this
sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why
the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Although the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is
a framework in which shifted confidence judgments is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | longitudinal attitude surveys | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | increased liking for chosen options | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | public versus private commitment | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It replaces meta-analytic synthesis with intuition.
   B. It proves devaluation of rejected alternatives is unique.
   C. May not generalize across contexts
   D. It makes public versus private commitment irrelevant.

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The discussion suggests that cultural norms about consistency is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. The author argues that meta-analytic synthesis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'post-choice attitude change' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where meta-analytic synthesis constrains cultural norms about consistency

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **subtle** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [B] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like choice-induced preference paradigms are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because public versus private commitment dominates all evidence
   C. slight
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using choice-induced preference paradigms.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when cultural norms about consistency can mimic increased liking for chosen options.
   C. The passage suggests that increased liking for chosen options is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving choice-induced preference paradigms.

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that devaluation of rejected alternatives is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-national survey samples. Finally, it maintains that tests combining choice-induced preference paradigms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   B. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using choice-induced preference paradigms are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats choice-induced preference paradigms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss devaluation of rejected alternatives or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting choice-induced preference paradigms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

6. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   B. behavioral priming designs
   C. shifted confidence judgments
   D. a list of Olympic medal counts

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The passage implies that 'noise' is sometimes a label for unmodeled structure rather than a property of the world itself.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on behavioral priming designs simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-national survey samples and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. meta-analytic synthesis as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. measurement reactivity alone, treated as the sole cause

10. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because cultural norms about consistency co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents shifted confidence judgments from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once shifted confidence judgments is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. Because shifted confidence judgments appears, the mechanism must be unique, so cultural norms about consistency can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
