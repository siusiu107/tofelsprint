Passage 0321: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 788)

Against that intuitive story, researchers found that researchers have treated school-quality
gradients as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Though audit studies in housing markets can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. In replication attempts, one sees why
the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike
European migrant neighborhoods. The passage argues that the same summary statistic could be
reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because path dependence from historical
redlining shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. The issue is not
treating school-quality gradients as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author
therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense, spatial stratification in
cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. Only after
the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from historical
redlining did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] The author uses the detour to show
why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. by comparing cases in which
audit studies in housing markets constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author treats this as a clue rather than
as a nuisance. Even though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value
of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] The passage
highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. [D] The discussion
treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. Only by the field adopted
tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from historical redlining was the field
forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which audit studies in housing markets constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps
explain why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Admittedly, a single case can be dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value
of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. If anything is
responsible, it is the apparent regularity of school-quality gradients, and therefore drives
the first interpretation: school-quality gradients is treated as a direct readout of
mechanism. Provided that school-quality gradients is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway, then observations from European migrant neighborhoods would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. Not the caveat that path dependence from historical
redlining might reproduce the same pattern, but the literature is full of such claims. In
this sense, segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label. The point is not X but methodological
humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the lesson of residential segregation and
the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference is constrained by what competing
models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to explanation, then
the same observation—school-quality gradients—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular
summaries treat school-quality gradients as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats
it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. The
decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as the
lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—school-quality gradients—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with
confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat school-quality gradients as an endpoint, the
passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.
In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage
concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing
assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | mobility tracking with administrative records | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | wealth accumulation gaps | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | path dependence from historical redlining | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Shifts the baseline
   B. It replaces longitudinal panel data with intuition.
   C. Can introduce systematic bias
   D. May be muted by other processes

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing theories?
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'urban sorting by race and income' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where audit studies in housing markets constrains informational asymmetries in housing search
   C. The passage treats wealth accumulation gaps as a confounder and informational asymmetries in housing search as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The author argues that audit studies in housing markets should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

3. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. Since disparate exposure to pollution is observed in post-industrial cities, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. Because zoning rules and land-use regulation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once disparate exposure to pollution is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. it prevents disparate exposure to pollution from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control zoning rules and land-use regulation

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
   B. longitudinal panel data
   C. school-quality gradients
   D. a list of Olympic medal counts

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because credit market discrimination dominates all evidence
   B. important
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like spatial autocorrelation analysis are needed
   D. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because disparate exposure to pollution uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that credit market discrimination is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal panel data are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like credit market discrimination make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal panel data as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that disparate exposure to pollution is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how credit market discrimination can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from rapidly growing Sun Belt regions. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal panel data with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal panel data as a historical curiosity and does not discuss disparate exposure to pollution or credit market discrimination. It ends without any methodological implication.

7. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: The issue is not treating school-quality gradients as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation.
   A. disparate exposure to pollution specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. audit studies in housing markets as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. credit market discrimination alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, something that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates path dependence from historical redlining.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on audit studies in housing markets simple.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in rapidly growing Sun Belt regions and everywhere else.

9. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats large U.S. metropolitan areas as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away zoning rules and land-use regulation, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when zoning rules and land-use regulation can mimic disparate exposure to pollution.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using longitudinal panel data.
