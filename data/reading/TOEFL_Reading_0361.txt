Passage 0361: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 716)

Under expanded parameter sweeps, the analysis suggests researchers have treated selectivity
shifts as the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. Admittedly,
microkinetic modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage
argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. [A] The author uses the example to separate detection
from interpretation. If one wishes to move from description to explanation, a different
prediction follows: then the same observation—selectivity shifts—must be paired with tests
that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The passage frames uncertainty as an
ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment. Whereas popular summaries treat
selectivity shifts as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting
point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be
stated. [C] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. [D] At
first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. In this
sense, surface-mediated catalysis on pt is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

Rarely has it been the case that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical, at least before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify facet
dependence. by comparing cases in which microkinetic modeling constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on facet dependence, the author treats the
complication as diagnostic, so many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum
surfaces as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized selectivity
shifts as a signature, later work asked whether the same signature survives when protocols
and baselines differ. this shift mattered for how evidence from electrochemical interfaces
was generalized because, as the author notes, local conditions can change which processes
generate selectivity shifts. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only after analysts began combining microkinetic modeling with cross-site comparisons did
claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped relying on a single figure
and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which
selectivity shifts could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like
facet dependence often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about
priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which helps explain why
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Using microkinetic modeling under stable conditions, the interpretation shifts, and one
frequently cited case from electrochemical interfaces appeared to support the direct-readout
view. Even if the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed
that small shifts in facet dependence altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic
selectivity shifts. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic; this, in turn,
illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted. In
this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which
helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying
that any story is arbitrary. Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive
answer is strong, the result is a framework in which selectivity shifts is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. structure-sensitive activity
   B. the author’s favorite color
   C. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   D. microkinetic modeling

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The passage implies that electrochemical interfaces is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where in situ spectroscopy constrains catalyst deactivation
   C. The discussion suggests that catalyst deactivation is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The passage treats rate enhancement as a confounder and catalyst deactivation as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like catalyst deactivation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting temperature-programmed desorption as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because poisoning by CO uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that catalyst deactivation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using temperature-programmed desorption are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats temperature-programmed desorption as a historical curiosity and does not discuss poisoning by CO or catalyst deactivation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that poisoning by CO is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how catalyst deactivation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from electrochemical interfaces. Finally, it maintains that tests combining temperature-programmed desorption with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.

4. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize confounder control?
   A. it prevents poisoning by CO from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control adsorbate coverage effects
   B. Because adsorbate coverage effects co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. Because poisoning by CO appears, the mechanism must be unique, so adsorbate coverage effects can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if surface microscopy produces a tight fit on one dataset.

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving in situ spectroscopy.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when catalyst deactivation can mimic structure-sensitive activity.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using in situ spectroscopy.
   D. The author treats automotive catalytic converters as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.
