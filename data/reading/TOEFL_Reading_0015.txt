Passage 0015: Shape-Memory Alloys and Reversible Crystal Transformations (Materials Science)
============================================================================================
(Word count: 629)

A paperclip bends and, if pushed too far, stays bent. A nickel‑titanium wire, by contrast,
can be twisted, stretched, and then return to its original shape as if the deformation had
been erased. This behavior, often marketed as “shape memory,” is not a trick of elastic
stiffness alone. It arises from a reversible change in crystal structure. In one state the
alloy’s atoms occupy a higher‑symmetry arrangement; in another they occupy a lower‑symmetry
arrangement that can accommodate strain by shifting variants rather than by permanently
sliding atomic planes.

The temperature‑driven form is the most intuitive. At low temperature, the alloy can exist
in a martensitic phase composed of multiple variants. When stress is applied, variants that
fit the stress direction grow at the expense of others, allowing large apparent deformation
without permanent damage. When the alloy is heated above a transformation range, it reverts
to the austenitic phase, and the variant pattern disappears, pulling the macroscopic shape
back to its original form. Because the transformation absorbs and releases latent heat, the
process is more like a phase change than like a rubber band snap.

A second, closely related behavior is superelasticity, which occurs not by heating but by
stress at a fixed temperature. If the alloy is slightly above its transformation range,
applying stress can induce martensite locally. The material appears to “yield,” yet when
stress is removed the induced martensite reverts and the strain is recovered. Engineers
value this behavior in medical stents: a stent can be compressed into a catheter, delivered
to a narrow artery, and then expand outward with gentle, sustained force. [A] The benefit
depends on an unusual plateau in the stress‑strain curve: instead of steadily rising stress
with strain, the material can deform substantially at nearly constant stress while the phase
transformation progresses. [B]

The same phase logic also explains why processing matters so much. Small changes in
composition can shift transformation temperatures, and heat treatments can change
precipitates that pin or release transformation fronts. If the alloy is too nickel‑rich,
transformation temperatures may drop below body temperature, improving superelasticity for
implants; if the alloy is adjusted differently, shape memory can be tuned to activate with
mild warming. Yet tuning has costs. A treatment that improves recoverable strain can reduce
fatigue life if it produces brittle precipitates or concentrates stress at grain boundaries.
[C] In cyclic applications, such as orthodontic wires that flex thousands of times, fatigue
becomes the limiting factor long before the dramatic “memory” effect fails in a single pull.

Designers therefore treat nickel‑titanium as a system that trades behaviors against one
another. High recoverable strain is valuable, but so is stable transformation over many
cycles and resistance to corrosion in body fluids. Surface oxidation can protect against
corrosion, yet surface defects can initiate cracks under repeated flexing. Moreover, the
very feature that makes the alloy useful—the moving phase boundary—creates internal
friction, which can generate heat and alter local transformation behavior under rapid
cycling.

Despite these complications, shape‑memory alloys are a reminder that mechanical behavior can
be engineered through structure, not merely through strength. [D] When a device “remembers,”
it is actually following an energetic path back to a preferred crystal arrangement. The
macroscopic return, which feels almost magical in the hand, is therefore an expression of
microscopic order: atoms shifting between phases, variants reorganizing under stress, and
heat defining which structure is stable at a given moment.

Another practical feature is hysteresis: the temperature at which the alloy transforms on
heating is not identical to the temperature at which it transforms on cooling. That gap can
be useful, because it stabilizes a device against small temperature fluctuations, but it can
also complicate precise activation if engineers need a sharp threshold.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The macroscopic return, which feels almost magical in the hand, is therefore an expression of microscopic order: atoms shifting between phases, variants reorganizing under stress, and heat defining which structure is stable at a given moment.
   A. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of temperature
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across temperature
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to transformation and alloy

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains stress by linking transformation to alloy, and it shows why temperature changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents alloy as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once transformation is observed, competing explanations for stress collapse. It treats temperature as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   C. The passage concedes that transformation is often incomplete and concludes that stress cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since temperature overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of alloy with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   D. The passage surveys stress but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed alloy first, with transformation serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats temperature as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, especially regarding strain.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage treats transformation primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over alloy are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about stress are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   B. The passage implies that temperature mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes transformation effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of alloy no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain stress, especially regarding strain.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how stress should change if temperature is altered, instead of assuming that transformation has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to alloy must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in temperature, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of transformation is enough to validate alloy for stress, especially regarding phase, in the context of the passage.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of alloy as a factor influencing transformation, under the stated assumptions.
   B. discussion of contact-zone multilingualism as a factor influencing transformation
   C. discussion of temperature as a factor influencing transformation
   D. discussion of stress as a factor influencing transformation

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: The macroscopic return, which feels almost magical in the hand, is therefore an expression of microscopic order: atoms shifting between phases, variants reorganizing under stress, and heat defining which structure is stable at a given moment.
   A. The macroscopic return. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   C. The macroscopic return. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because transformation directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding stress.
   B. Because comparability prevents alloy from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold temperature constant while examining transformation.
   C. Because the presence of alloy guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in temperature are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because once transformation fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and temperature can be ignored without changing conclusions about stress.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | transformation | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | temperature | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves alloy is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that stress should be read alongside temperature, because transformation alone does not settle what alloy means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This behavior, often marketed as “shape memory,” is not a trick of elastic stiffness alone.
   A. the preceding claim that transformation is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   B. the preceding claim about how transformation is interpreted in relation to alloy
   C. the preceding claim that temperature alone explains the outcome of stress
   D. the preceding claim that stress functions as a direct measurement of alloy

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of transformation lead to different conclusions about stress.
   B. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of transformation and alloy should be abandoned altogether, in the setting discussed.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses alloy, so debate over transformation is unnecessary noise, in the examples provided.
   D. to show that the term stress belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
