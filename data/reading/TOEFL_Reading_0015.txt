Passage 0015: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 637)

Despite apparently clean spectra, researchers have treated spurious molecular detections as
the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy. Even though Gaussian-
process detrending can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which is precisely
why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on starspot temperature contrasts, the key
question becomes whether many early studies framed stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized spurious
molecular detections as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under
replication. this shift mattered for how evidence from active K-dwarf host stars was
generalized because local conditions can change which processes generate spurious molecular
detections. In this sense, unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The author uses the example to
separate detection from interpretation. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation is granted, then the same observation—spurious molecular detections—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The passage signals
that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. Whereas popular summaries treat spurious
molecular detections as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting
point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under
replication. [C] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as
conditional. [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.

Never before analysts began combining Gaussian-process detrending with cross-site
comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which spurious molecular detections could
be explained in more than one way because confounders like starspot temperature contrasts
often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an
empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable. In this sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Using Gaussian-process detrending under stable conditions, the passage suggests one
frequently cited case from active K-dwarf host stars appeared to support the direct-readout
view. the original fit looked visually decisive; still, later, however, reanalysis showed
that small shifts in starspot temperature contrasts altered the baseline enough to mute or
mimic spurious molecular detections. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, a move
that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. In this sense, photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Even if the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is
a framework in which spurious molecular detections is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates facula coverage fractions.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on chromatic transit analysis simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because rotation-modulated light curves uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in M-dwarf systems with repeated transits and everywhere else.

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This is why the author dwells on assumptions: without them, two teams can analyze the same record and still disagree honestly.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'photospheric contamination of transmission spectra' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
   B. The discussion suggests that starspot temperature contrasts is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. The passage implies that M-dwarf systems with repeated transits is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where simultaneous photometric monitoring constrains starspot temperature contrasts

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Gaussian-process detrending
   B. spurious molecular detections
   C. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy
   D. the length of the Nile in miles

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like facula coverage fractions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting chromatic transit analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that rotation-modulated light curves is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how facula coverage fractions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from multi-epoch JWST targets. Finally, it maintains that tests combining chromatic transit analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats chromatic transit analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rotation-modulated light curves or facula coverage fractions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because rotation-modulated light curves uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that facula coverage fractions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using chromatic transit analysis are unnecessary.

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
