Passage 0759: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 763)

When adoption is measured in aggregates, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated
disparate exposure to pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality. While it is true that quasi-experimental policy
evaluation can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which helps explain
why forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

Even though the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how zoning rules and
land-use regulation can shift baselines, altering whether disparate exposure to pollution is
even comparable across cases; this, in turn, means that a good fit is not the same as a good
explanation. Provided that zoning rules and land-use regulation is changed while the nominal
driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed.
In this sense, spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Using quasi-experimental policy evaluation under stable conditions, the interpretation
shifts, and one frequently cited case from post-industrial cities appeared to support the
direct-readout view. [A] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating them
as afterthoughts. Even if the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in zoning rules and land-use regulation altered the
baseline enough to mute or mimic disparate exposure to pollution. [B] The passage signals
that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic; this, in turn, illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted. [C] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author
frames it as conditional. [D] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a
decisive test.

Never before analysts began combining quasi-experimental policy evaluation with cross-site
comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate
exposure to pollution could be explained in more than one way largely because confounders
like zoning rules and land-use regulation often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In
this sense, segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move
from description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—disparate exposure to
pollution—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat disparate exposure to pollution as an endpoint may be
convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is scientifically revealing.

The decisive factor is the apparent regularity of disparate exposure to pollution; once that
is stated, drives the first interpretation: disparate exposure to pollution is treated as a
direct readout of mechanism. Should disparate exposure to pollution is uniquely produced by
one causal pathway be true, then observations from post-industrial cities would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. So the literature is full of such
claims, and so, too, does the evidence undermine the caveat that zoning rules and land-use
regulation might reproduce the same pattern. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level
disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why
the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Despite the fact that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong,
the result is a framework in which disparate exposure to pollution is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. disparate exposure to pollution specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. informational asymmetries in housing search alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. longitudinal panel data as a device rather than as an analytic approach

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that path dependence from historical redlining is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using quasi-experimental policy evaluation are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting quasi-experimental policy evaluation as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how path dependence from historical redlining can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from large U.S. metropolitan areas. Finally, it maintains that tests combining quasi-experimental policy evaluation with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats quasi-experimental policy evaluation as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or path dependence from historical redlining. It ends without any methodological implication.

3. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Since disparate exposure to pollution is observed in large U.S. metropolitan areas, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once disparate exposure to pollution is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. The passage implies that longitudinal panel data directly measures causes, meaning confounding from zoning rules and land-use regulation is impossible.
   D. it prevents disparate exposure to pollution from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control zoning rules and land-use regulation

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the inference is underdetermined, the most informative tests are those that break degeneracies rather than those that merely sharpen one feature.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates zoning rules and land-use regulation.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in European migrant neighborhoods and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on mobility tracking with administrative records simple.

6. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when informational asymmetries in housing search can mimic disparate exposure to pollution.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using spatial autocorrelation analysis.
   C. The author treats post-industrial cities as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   D. The passage suggests that disparate exposure to pollution is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **attenuated** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Even if the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in zoning rules and land-use regulation altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic disparate exposure to pollution.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because credit market discrimination dominates all evidence
   B. weakened
   C. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
