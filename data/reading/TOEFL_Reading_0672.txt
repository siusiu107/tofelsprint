Passage 0672: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 642)

Despite apparently clean spectra, the passage argues that researchers have treated spurious
molecular detections as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
Though simultaneous photometric monitoring can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, it becomes plausible that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike M-dwarf systems with repeated transits.
the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed
largely because instrument drift across visits shifted the baseline in different directions
across sites. The issue is not treating spurious molecular detections as a self-sufficient
conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this
sense, unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to
explanation be true, then the same observation—spurious molecular detections—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries
treat spurious molecular detections as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting
point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify instrument drift across
visits, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. [A] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be
discarded. by comparing cases in which simultaneous photometric monitoring constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is
precisely why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B]
This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Even if
a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. [C] The passage signals that a tidy fit may
hide degenerate explanations. [D] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts
as evidence. In this sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—spurious molecular detections—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat spurious molecular detections as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. In this sense,
photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is
precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary. While it is true that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a
definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which spurious molecular
detections is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the inference is underdetermined, the most informative tests are those that break degeneracies rather than those that merely sharpen one feature.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates starspot temperature contrasts.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in multi-epoch JWST targets and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on chromatic transit analysis simple.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering uniquely identifies one mechanism.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. multi-epoch transit campaigns
   B. apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering
   C. a list of Olympic medal counts
   D. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like facula coverage fractions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting Gaussian-process detrending as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats Gaussian-process detrending as a historical curiosity and does not discuss time-variable spectral baselines or facula coverage fractions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that time-variable spectral baselines is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how facula coverage fractions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from bright nearby planet hosts. Finally, it maintains that tests combining Gaussian-process detrending with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   D. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that facula coverage fractions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using Gaussian-process detrending are unnecessary.

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. spurious molecular detections specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. spot–facular forward modeling as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. instrument drift across visits alone, treated as the sole cause

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. Because time-variable spectral baselines appears, the mechanism must be unique, so facula coverage fractions can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if spot–facular forward modeling produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. The passage implies that spot–facular forward modeling directly measures causes, meaning confounding from facula coverage fractions is impossible.
   D. it prevents time-variable spectral baselines from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control facula coverage fractions

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **degenerate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [C] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because facula coverage fractions dominates all evidence
   B. not uniquely determined
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like multi-epoch transit campaigns are needed
   D. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail

8. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facula coverage fractions can mimic rotation-modulated light curves.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using spot–facular forward modeling.
   C. The author treats active K-dwarf host stars as a special case and argues that no broader inference about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy is possible.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving spot–facular forward modeling.

9. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | spot–facular forward modeling | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | time-variable spectral baselines | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | limb-darkening model mismatch | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It proves rotation-modulated light curves is unique.
   B. Requires careful calibration
   C. Can vary across epochs
   D. It makes instrument drift across visits irrelevant.

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'photospheric contamination of transmission spectra' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
   B. The author argues that chromatic transit analysis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage implies that M-dwarf systems with repeated transits is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where chromatic transit analysis constrains facula coverage fractions
