Passage 0036: Reading Exoplanet Atmospheres from Transit Colors (Astronomy)
===========================================================================
(Word count: 646)

When a planet passes in front of its star, the star’s light dims slightly, producing a
transit. The dip in brightness is a geometric event: a disk crossing a disk. Yet transits
can reveal more than size and orbit. A thin ring of starlight skims the planet’s limb,
passing through whatever gases surround the planet before reaching a telescope. Because
gases absorb light at specific wavelengths, the transit depth can change subtly with color.
By measuring those changes, astronomers can infer the presence of molecules in an
exoplanet’s atmosphere.

The method is called transmission spectroscopy. Its logic is simple, but its execution is
demanding. The atmospheric signature is small because only a tiny fraction of starlight
passes through the atmospheric annulus. A planet with a puffy atmosphere can produce a
larger signal than a compact planet, and a hot planet with a large scale height—an
atmosphere that extends farther upward—can be easier to diagnose than a cold, dense one. [A]
In effect, gravity and temperature control how much atmosphere is available to imprint
itself on the transit.

Different molecules leave different patterns. Water vapor produces absorption bands in the
near-infrared; sodium can leave a narrow feature in the visible; methane and carbon monoxide
have distinct fingerprints at longer wavelengths. By comparing a measured spectrum to
models, researchers can estimate composition. But composition is entangled with structure.
If an atmosphere contains high-altitude aerosols that scatter light, the spectrum can appear
muted, making molecular bands shallower. If the star itself has spots and faculae, the
stellar surface can imprint spectral features that masquerade as planetary signals. The
planet is therefore not the only actor; the star is part of the experiment.

Despite these complications, transmission spectra have revealed broad trends. Hot
Jupiters—giant planets orbiting very close to their stars—often show sodium or water
signatures, and their inflated atmospheres can be shaped by intense stellar irradiation.
Smaller planets are harder. A rocky planet’s atmosphere, if it exists, is thin relative to
its radius, so the transit signal is tiny. Yet in a few cases, observations suggest
atmospheres dominated by hydrogen, implying that some “mini-Neptunes” retained primordial
gas envelopes. [B] The boundary between a large rocky planet and a small gas-rich planet is,
in this sense, written in absorption features.

Composition matters because it connects to origin. A planet that formed beyond a snow line
may accrete icy material, which can enrich its atmosphere in oxygen-bearing molecules.
Migration can move such a planet inward, placing it under higher irradiation than its
initial chemistry evolved for. Atmospheric escape then becomes important. High-energy
photons can heat upper layers, allowing light gases to flow away. Over billions of years,
escape can strip a planet, turning a sub-Neptune into a bare rocky core. Evidence for escape
appears as extended hydrogen seen at ultraviolet wavelengths, sometimes producing deeper
transits in those bands than in optical light.

New observatories have sharpened this field by providing stable spectra across broad
wavelength ranges. Yet the most valuable progress often comes from combining methods.
Emission spectroscopy during secondary eclipse can probe dayside temperatures. Phase curves
track brightness as the planet orbits, revealing heat transport by winds. Transmission
remains a key piece, because it samples the terminator region, where day and night meet and
chemistry can differ from either side. [C] An atmosphere is not a uniform shell; it is a
dynamic fluid influenced by radiation, rotation, and circulation.

In the end, atmospheric inference from transits is an argument assembled from subtle color-
dependent shadows. [D] It requires careful separation of stellar effects, instrumental
systematics, and planetary physics. When the separation is done well, a distant planet
becomes more than a point of light: it becomes a world with gases that absorb, scatter, and
escape, telling a story of formation and evolution written in wavelengths too faint for the
eye to see.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: When the separation is done well, a distant planet becomes more than a point of light: it becomes a world with gases that absorb, scatter, and escape, telling a story of formation and evolution written in wavelengths too faint for the eye to see.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to atmosphere and light
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across transit
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of transit
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains planet by linking atmosphere to light, and it shows why transit changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage surveys planet but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed light first, with atmosphere serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats transit as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   C. The passage presents light as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once atmosphere is observed, competing explanations for planet collapse. It treats transit as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   D. The passage concedes that atmosphere is often incomplete and concludes that planet cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since transit overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of light with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, especially regarding light.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage treats atmosphere primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over light are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about planet are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in transit, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of atmosphere is enough to validate light for planet, in the cases described, as the argument develops.
   C. The passage implies that transit mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes atmosphere effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of light no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain planet, within the passage’s scope.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how planet should change if transit is altered, instead of assuming that atmosphere has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to light must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of archival bias as a factor influencing atmosphere
   B. discussion of planet as a factor influencing atmosphere
   C. discussion of light as a factor influencing atmosphere, for the main claim of the text.
   D. discussion of transit as a factor influencing atmosphere

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: When the separation is done well, a distant planet becomes more than a point of light: it becomes a world with gases that absorb, scatter, and escape, telling a story of formation and evolution written in wavelengths too faint for the eye to see.
   A. When the separation is done well. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   D. When the separation is done well. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because atmosphere directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding planet.
   B. Because the presence of light guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in transit are merely stylistic noise.
   C. Because comparability prevents light from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold transit constant while examining atmosphere.
   D. Because once atmosphere fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and transit can be ignored without changing conclusions about planet.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | atmosphere | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | transit | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It proves light is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that planet should be read alongside transit, because atmosphere alone does not settle what light means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "this" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] The boundary between a large rocky planet and a small gas-rich planet is, in this sense, written in absorption features.
   A. the idea that Different molecules leave different patterns, within the passage’s scope, as the discussion implies.
   B. the idea that Yet in a few cases, observations suggest atmospheres dominated by hydrogen, implying that some “mini-Neptunes” retained primordial gas envelopes
   C. the idea that A rocky planet’s atmosphere, if it exists, is thin relative to its radius, so the transit signal is tiny.
   D. the idea that Composition matters because it connects to origin, within the passage’s scope.
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of atmosphere lead to different conclusions about planet.
   B. to show that the term planet belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses light, so debate over atmosphere is unnecessary noise, especially regarding light.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of atmosphere and light should be abandoned altogether, for the phenomenon at issue.
