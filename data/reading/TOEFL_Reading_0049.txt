Passage 0049: Trophic Cascades and How Predators Reshape Ecosystems Indirectly (Ecology)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 614)

If one removes a predator from an ecosystem, the most obvious consequence is that prey
numbers rise. The less obvious consequence is that vegetation, stream structure, and even
neighboring species can change, sometimes dramatically. This chain reaction is known as a
trophic cascade. The term does not imply that every ecosystem behaves like a simple domino
line, but it highlights that certain interactions have outsized influence because they sit
at key points in food webs. When those interactions change, energy flow and behavior can be
reorganized across multiple levels.

A classic example comes from kelp forests. Sea otters eat sea urchins, and sea urchins graze
kelp. When otters are abundant, urchin grazing is controlled, and kelp forests can flourish,
providing habitat for fish and invertebrates. When otters are removed, urchins can
proliferate and strip kelp, producing “urchin barrens” with far less structural complexity.
The shift is not merely a matter of plant biomass; it alters refuge availability, species
composition, and nutrient cycling. [A] In effect, a top predator can indirectly create
habitat by restricting the consumers that would otherwise erase it.

On land, wolves and elk have been used to argue for similar cascades. If wolves reduce elk
numbers or change elk behavior, browsing pressure on young trees can decline, allowing
riparian vegetation to recover. More shrubs and trees can stabilize banks, shade streams,
and provide food for insects that become fish prey. Critics note that these systems are more
complex than a three-step chain: climate, human hunting, and other predators also matter,
and measuring “behavioral fear effects” is methodologically difficult. Yet complexity does
not erase the core point that predators can matter through behavior as well as through
mortality. If prey avoid risky areas, plants in those areas can grow.

Cascades can also be mediated by mid-level predators. When apex predators disappear, smaller
predators can increase, a pattern called mesopredator release. For instance, removing large
carnivores can allow fox populations to expand, which can increase predation on ground-
nesting birds. In that case, restoring an apex predator could benefit a species it never
eats by suppressing a different predator. [B] The cascade is then not a single chain but a
network of indirect effects, some of which only become visible after a shift in one
controlling node.

Because cascades involve behavior and context, they can be patchy. A predator may influence
prey strongly in open areas but weakly in dense cover. Human infrastructure can interrupt
interactions: fences, roads, and livestock management can alter where predators hunt and
where prey feed. Moreover, prey can adapt. If prey learn new escape strategies or shift
diets, the strength of the cascade can change. This is why ecologists often speak of
“contingent” cascades: the mechanism exists, but its magnitude depends on local conditions.

Despite these qualifications, cascades have practical implications. Kelp restoration efforts
sometimes fail if urchins are not controlled, even when kelp is replanted. River restoration
can be constrained if browsing pressure remains high, even when water quality improves.
Managing for biodiversity may therefore require attention to interaction structure, not just
to species counts. [C] In systems where a few relationships regulate many others, protecting
or restoring those relationships can be as important as protecting individual species. [D]

What appears, from afar, to be a simple food chain is therefore better understood as a web
in which a few interactions can reorganize many others.

Questions
---------
1. [Vocabulary] The word “outsized” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. biologically irrelevant in sense
   B. carefully measured in sense
   C. temporarily delayed in sense
   D. disproportionately large in sense


2. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The predator’s influence, then, can be expressed through the architecture of the ecosystem, not only through prey bodies.
   A. [C]
   B. [A]
   C. [D]
   D. [B]


3. [Factual] According to the passage, what happens in kelp systems when sea otters are removed?
   A. Sea urchins increase and can overgraze kelp, creating barren areas by tying the effect to ecosystem.
   B. Sea urchins increase and can overgraze kelp, creating barren areas.
   C. Sea urchins increase and can solely overgraze kelp, creating barren areas. That would make sometimes the primary constraint.
   D. Sea urchins decrease and can overgraze kelp, creating barren areas. This would require influence to be the limiting factor.


4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why ecologists call some cascades “contingent”?
   A. Their strength depends on local context such as habitat structure, human interference, and prey adaptation. This outcome would hold even if ecosystems stays constant.
   B. Their strength depends on local context such as habitat structure, human interference, and prey adaptation. This would require human to be the limiting factor.
   C. Their strength depends on local context such as habitat vegetation, human interference, and prey adaptation. This would require mid-level to be the limiting factor.
   D. Their strength depends on local context such as habitat structure, human interference, and prey adaptation.

   C. Einstein ring geometry in gravitational lensing.
   D. difficulty measuring behavioral fear effects.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss mesopredator release?
   A. To show that removing apex predators must indirectly harm species via increases in mid-level predators. That would make complexity the primary constraint.
   B. To show that removing apex sometimes can indirectly harm species via increases in mid-level predators. This outcome would hold even if sometimes stays constant.

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that predators can matter through behavior as well as mortality?
   A. Even if predators do not kill many prey, the risk of predation can change prey foraging locations and thus plant growth.
