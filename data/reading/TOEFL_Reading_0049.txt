Passage 0049: Trophic Cascades and How Predators Reshape Ecosystems Indirectly (Ecology)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 614)

If one removes a predator from an ecosystem, the most obvious consequence is that prey
numbers rise. The less obvious consequence is that vegetation, stream structure, and even
neighboring species can change, sometimes dramatically. This chain reaction is known as a
trophic cascade. The term does not imply that every ecosystem behaves like a simple domino
line, but it highlights that certain interactions have outsized influence because they sit
at key points in food webs. When those interactions change, energy flow and behavior can be
reorganized across multiple levels.

A classic example comes from kelp forests. Sea otters eat sea urchins, and sea urchins graze
kelp. When otters are abundant, urchin grazing is controlled, and kelp forests can flourish,
providing habitat for fish and invertebrates. When otters are removed, urchins can
proliferate and strip kelp, producing “urchin barrens” with far less structural complexity.
The shift is not merely a matter of plant biomass; it alters refuge availability, species
composition, and nutrient cycling. [A] In effect, a top predator can indirectly create
habitat by restricting the consumers that would otherwise erase it.

On land, wolves and elk have been used to argue for similar cascades. If wolves reduce elk
numbers or change elk behavior, browsing pressure on young trees can decline, allowing
riparian vegetation to recover. More shrubs and trees can stabilize banks, shade streams,
and provide food for insects that become fish prey. Critics note that these systems are more
complex than a three-step chain: climate, human hunting, and other predators also matter,
and measuring “behavioral fear effects” is methodologically difficult. Yet complexity does
not erase the core point that predators can matter through behavior as well as through
mortality. If prey avoid risky areas, plants in those areas can grow.

Cascades can also be mediated by mid-level predators. When apex predators disappear, smaller
predators can increase, a pattern called mesopredator release. For instance, removing large
carnivores can allow fox populations to expand, which can increase predation on ground-
nesting birds. In that case, restoring an apex predator could benefit a species it never
eats by suppressing a different predator. [B] The cascade is then not a single chain but a
network of indirect effects, some of which only become visible after a shift in one
controlling node.

Because cascades involve behavior and context, they can be patchy. A predator may influence
prey strongly in open areas but weakly in dense cover. Human infrastructure can interrupt
interactions: fences, roads, and livestock management can alter where predators hunt and
where prey feed. Moreover, prey can adapt. If prey learn new escape strategies or shift
diets, the strength of the cascade can change. This is why ecologists often speak of
“contingent” cascades: the mechanism exists, but its magnitude depends on local conditions.

Despite these qualifications, cascades have practical implications. Kelp restoration efforts
sometimes fail if urchins are not controlled, even when kelp is replanted. River restoration
can be constrained if browsing pressure remains high, even when water quality improves.
Managing for biodiversity may therefore require attention to interaction structure, not just
to species counts. [C] In systems where a few relationships regulate many others, protecting
or restoring those relationships can be as important as protecting individual species. [D]

What appears, from afar, to be a simple food chain is therefore better understood as a web
in which a few interactions can reorganize many others.

   B. difficulty measuring behavioral fear effects
   C. human infrastructure altering interactions
   D. Einstein ring geometry in gravitational lensing

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss mesopredator release?
   A. To show that removing apex predators can indirectly harm species via increases in mid-level predators
   B. To argue that apex predators never matter in ecosystems
   C. To claim that foxes are apex predators everywhere
   D. To suggest that cascades occur only through plant biomass

7. [Reference] In the passage, “these qualifications” refers to:
   A. the complexities and context-dependence that make cascades variable and patchy
   B. the chemical steps of carbonation in plaster
   C. the rules of policy diffusion mechanisms
   D. the phase transformation temperatures of Nitinol

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It defines trophic cascades, presents marine and terrestrial examples, adds network complications like mesopredator release, then explains why context matters and why cascades matter for management
   B. It lists predator species without explaining indirect effects
   C. It argues that food webs are irrelevant to biodiversity
   D. It focuses only on river chemistry and not organisms

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that predators can matter through behavior as well as mortality?
   A. Even if predators do not kill many prey, the risk of predation can change prey foraging locations and thus plant growth
   B. Only the number of prey killed determines all ecological outcomes
   C. Behavior changes cannot influence vegetation
   D. Predators influence ecosystems only by eating plants

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Trophic cascades describe ecosystems where predators affect only prey and never influence plants or habitat.
   B. The passage explains trophic cascades as indirect effects in food webs, illustrates them with kelp–urchin–otter and wolf–elk vegetation dynamics, shows how network features like mesopredator release and context make cascades variable, and argues that managing ecosystems may require protecting key interactions, not only species counts.
   C. Cascades prove that climate and human actions are irrelevant to ecosystems.
   D. Removing predators always produces identical results across all habitats.
