Passage 0049: Trophic Cascades and How Predators Reshape Ecosystems Indirectly (Ecology)
========================================================================================
(Word count: 614)

If one removes a predator from an ecosystem, the most obvious consequence is that prey
numbers rise. The less obvious consequence is that vegetation, stream structure, and even
neighboring species can change, sometimes dramatically. This chain reaction is known as a
trophic cascade. The term does not imply that every ecosystem behaves like a simple domino
line, but it highlights that certain interactions have outsized influence because they sit
at key points in food webs. When those interactions change, energy flow and behavior can be
reorganized across multiple levels.

A classic example comes from kelp forests. Sea otters eat sea urchins, and sea urchins graze
kelp. When otters are abundant, urchin grazing is controlled, and kelp forests can flourish,
providing habitat for fish and invertebrates. When otters are removed, urchins can
proliferate and strip kelp, producing “urchin barrens” with far less structural complexity.
The shift is not merely a matter of plant biomass; it alters refuge availability, species
composition, and nutrient cycling. [A] In effect, a top predator can indirectly create
habitat by restricting the consumers that would otherwise erase it.

On land, wolves and elk have been used to argue for similar cascades. If wolves reduce elk
numbers or change elk behavior, browsing pressure on young trees can decline, allowing
riparian vegetation to recover. More shrubs and trees can stabilize banks, shade streams,
and provide food for insects that become fish prey. Critics note that these systems are more
complex than a three-step chain: climate, human hunting, and other predators also matter,
and measuring “behavioral fear effects” is methodologically difficult. Yet complexity does
not erase the core point that predators can matter through behavior as well as through
mortality. If prey avoid risky areas, plants in those areas can grow.

Cascades can also be mediated by mid-level predators. When apex predators disappear, smaller
predators can increase, a pattern called mesopredator release. For instance, removing large
carnivores can allow fox populations to expand, which can increase predation on ground-
nesting birds. In that case, restoring an apex predator could benefit a species it never
eats by suppressing a different predator. [B] The cascade is then not a single chain but a
network of indirect effects, some of which only become visible after a shift in one
controlling node.

Because cascades involve behavior and context, they can be patchy. A predator may influence
prey strongly in open areas but weakly in dense cover. Human infrastructure can interrupt
interactions: fences, roads, and livestock management can alter where predators hunt and
where prey feed. Moreover, prey can adapt. If prey learn new escape strategies or shift
diets, the strength of the cascade can change. This is why ecologists often speak of
“contingent” cascades: the mechanism exists, but its magnitude depends on local conditions.

Despite these qualifications, cascades have practical implications. Kelp restoration efforts
sometimes fail if urchins are not controlled, even when kelp is replanted. River restoration
can be constrained if browsing pressure remains high, even when water quality improves.
Managing for biodiversity may therefore require attention to interaction structure, not just
to species counts. [C] In systems where a few relationships regulate many others, protecting
or restoring those relationships can be as important as protecting individual species. [D]

What appears, from afar, to be a simple food chain is therefore better understood as a web
in which a few interactions can reorganize many others.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The term does not imply that every ecosystem behaves like a simple domino line, but it highlights that certain interactions have outsized influence because they sit at key points in food webs.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across predator
   B. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of predator
   C. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to interactions and predators
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains chain by linking interactions to predators, and it shows why predator changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage presents predators as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once interactions is observed, competing explanations for chain collapse. It treats predator as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion, especially regarding chain.
   C. The passage concedes that interactions is often incomplete and concludes that chain cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since predator overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of predators with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   D. The passage surveys chain but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed predators first, with interactions serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats predator as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that predator mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes interactions effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of predators no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain chain, for the phenomenon at issue, under the stated assumptions.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in predator, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of interactions is enough to validate predators for chain.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how chain should change if predator is altered, instead of assuming that interactions has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to predators must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. The passage treats interactions primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over predators are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about chain are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of archival bias as a factor influencing interactions
   B. discussion of predators as a factor influencing interactions
   C. discussion of chain as a factor influencing interactions, especially regarding species.
   D. discussion of predator as a factor influencing interactions

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: The term does not imply that every ecosystem behaves like a simple domino line, but it highlights that certain interactions have outsized influence because they sit at key points in food webs.
   A. The term does not imply that every ecosystem behaves like a simple domino line. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding species, especially regarding cascades.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   D. The term does not imply that every ecosystem behaves like a simple domino line. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because comparability prevents predators from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold predator constant while examining interactions.
   B. Because once interactions fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and predator can be ignored without changing conclusions about chain.
   C. Because the presence of predators guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in predator are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because interactions directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding chain.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | interactions | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | predator | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It proves predators is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that chain should be read alongside predator, because interactions alone does not settle what predators means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This chain reaction is known as a trophic cascade.
   A. the idea that This is why ecologists often speak of “contingent” cascades: the mechanism exists, but its magnitude depends on local conditions
   B. the idea that If one removes a predator from an ecosystem, the most obvious consequence is that prey numbers rise
   C. the idea that The less obvious consequence is that vegetation, stream structure, and even neighboring species can change, sometimes dramatically
   D. the idea that The term does not imply that every ecosystem behaves like a simple domino line, but it highlights that certain interactions have outsized influence because...
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of interactions lead to different conclusions about chain.
   B. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses predators, so debate over interactions is unnecessary noise, especially regarding interactions.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of interactions and predators should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to show that the term chain belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope, especially regarding cascades.
