Passage 0090: Absolute Pitch, Sensitive Periods, and the Cultural Limits of a Rare Skill (Cognition/Music)
==========================================================================================================
(Word count: 609)

Absolute pitch—the ability to identify or produce a musical note without an external
reference—has long fascinated musicians and scientists because it seems to contradict the
everyday experience that pitch is relational. Most people can tell that one note is higher
than another, yet they cannot label a note as “F-sharp” in isolation. Those with absolute
pitch can, often with striking speed, naming notes as readily as naming colors. The ability
appears rare, unevenly distributed, and tightly linked to both biology and experience.

Research suggests that early musical exposure is a powerful predictor. Many absolute-pitch
possessors began formal training in early childhood, and the prevalence is higher among
speakers of tone languages such as Mandarin, in which pitch contours distinguish word
meanings. This pattern has led to the hypothesis of a sensitive period: a developmental
window during which the brain can map stable categories onto pitches with lasting precision.
[A] If training begins after the window narrows, the brain may still learn to discriminate
pitch, but it may do so relationally rather than categorically.

The tone-language association, however, is not straightforward. Tone languages require
relative pitch patterns across syllables, not the fixed labeling of a piano’s equal-tempered
scale. Moreover, many tone-language speakers do not have absolute pitch, and many absolute-
pitch musicians do not speak tone languages. One plausible bridge is that tone-language
learning trains attention to pitch as a linguistically meaningful feature, making it easier,
under early musical training, to bind pitches to verbal labels. In that view, language does
not implant absolute pitch; it shifts what children attend to while their auditory
categories are forming.

Neuroscience findings add texture. Imaging studies often report that absolute-pitch
musicians show differences in regions associated with auditory perception and labeling,
including asymmetries in the planum temporale. Some studies suggest more efficient links
between auditory representations and verbal memory, consistent with the speed of naming. Yet
neural differences could be both cause and consequence: intensive training itself can
remodel auditory cortex, and people who find pitch labeling easy may practice more. Genetic
factors have been proposed, but no single “absolute pitch gene” has been identified;
instead, the trait likely reflects a combination of predispositions and early environments.

Absolute pitch also has costs. In music that uses tuning systems different from equal
temperament, such as historical temperaments or certain non-Western scales, fixed labeling
can become confusing. A note tuned slightly low may feel “wrong” to an absolute-pitch
listener, even if the ensemble is internally consistent. Some musicians report annoyance
when a piece is transposed, because the expected labels no longer match. Relative pitch, by
contrast, supports transposition naturally because it tracks intervals. [B] Thus, the trait
is not a universal advantage; it is an adaptation to a particular musical culture.

For educators, the implication is pragmatic. Early training and rich musical environments
can nurture categorical pitch memory in some children, yet forcing the skill is unlikely to
work if the sensitive period has passed or if motivation is absent. Moreover, because
musicianship relies heavily on relative pitch, rhythmic skill, and expressive timing,
treating absolute pitch as the apex of talent is misleading. [C] It is one specialized
ability among many, not a guarantee of artistry.

Absolute pitch, then, sits at the intersection of development, attention, and culture. [D]
It reminds researchers that what appears like a mysterious gift may emerge from ordinary
learning mechanisms operating at an extraordinary time.

Because early training matters, many studies compare musicians who began before age six with
those who started later, holding exposure constant.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] The word “sensitive period” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a developmental window when learning certain categories is especially effective
   B. a musical tempo marking that indicates softness
   C. a period of time when instruments are out of tune
   D. a legal interval for renewing fishing permits

2. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In that case, categories become as familiar as words, and retrieval becomes rapid rather than effortful.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Inference] What can be inferred about why tone-language experience might be associated with higher absolute-pitch prevalence?
   A. It may train attention to pitch as meaningful early in life, which can facilitate binding pitch categories to labels during early music training
   B. It guarantees absolute pitch for all speakers regardless of musical practice
   C. It eliminates the need for any sensitive period in development
   D. It forces the auditory cortex to stop remodeling after childhood

4. [Factual] According to the passage, which statement about tone languages and absolute pitch is supported?
   A. Tone-language learning may increase attention to pitch, but it does not by itself guarantee absolute pitch
   B. Tone languages teach the equal-tempered scale explicitly in childhood
   C. All tone-language speakers have absolute pitch automatically
   D. Absolute pitch is impossible for anyone who speaks a non-tone language

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss historical temperaments and non-Western scales?
   A. To illustrate that absolute pitch can be inconvenient when tuning systems differ from the fixed categories an individual expects
   B. To argue that equal temperament is biologically inevitable
   C. To show that transposition is impossible for relative-pitch musicians
   D. To claim that absolute pitch improves rhythmic skill directly

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as contributors to absolute pitch EXCEPT:
   A. early musical training
   B. attention shaped by language experience
   C. possible genetic predispositions
   D. oxygen storage in cerium oxide buffers

7. [Reference] In the passage, “the trait” refers to:
   A. absolute pitch as an ability to label notes without reference
   B. serotiny in lodgepole pines
   C. quota leasing arrangements in fisheries
   D. methane hydrate stability in sediments

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It defines absolute pitch, then evaluates evidence for early training and language links, considers neurological and genetic perspectives, notes potential drawbacks, and concludes with implications for education and culture
   B. It presents a biography of a single musician only
   C. It argues that absolute pitch is purely genetic and independent of experience
   D. It focuses solely on rhythm training and ignores pitch perception

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that absolute pitch is not a universal advantage?
   A. Because fixed labeling can conflict with alternative tuning systems or transposition, the ability can sometimes hinder flexibility
   B. Absolute pitch improves every aspect of musicianship in every culture
   C. The ability prevents annoyance because tuning never varies
   D. Relative pitch is useless because intervals are unstable

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Absolute pitch is described as common and easily taught to adults through short practice.
   B. The passage describes absolute pitch as a rare ability to label notes without reference, argues that early training and attention to pitch—sometimes influenced by tone-language experience—are associated with its development, notes neurological and possible genetic contributions without a single gene explanation, and emphasizes that the skill can be culturally specific and sometimes inconvenient, making it one specialized ability rather than the pinnacle of musicianship.
   C. Tone languages are said to create absolute pitch by teaching equal temperament explicitly in everyday speech.
   D. Absolute pitch is presented as purely a defect that always harms musical performance.
