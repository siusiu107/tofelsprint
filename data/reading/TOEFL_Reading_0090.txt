Passage 0090: Absolute Pitch, Sensitive Periods, and the Cultural Limits of a Rare Skill (Cognition/Music)
==========================================================================================================
(Word count: 609)

Absolute pitch—the ability to identify or produce a musical note without an external
reference—has long fascinated musicians and scientists because it seems to contradict the
everyday experience that pitch is relational. Most people can tell that one note is higher
than another, yet they cannot label a note as “F-sharp” in isolation. Those with absolute
pitch can, often with striking speed, naming notes as readily as naming colors. The ability
appears rare, unevenly distributed, and tightly linked to both biology and experience.

Research suggests that early musical exposure is a powerful predictor. Many absolute-pitch
possessors began formal training in early childhood, and the prevalence is higher among
speakers of tone languages such as Mandarin, in which pitch contours distinguish word
meanings. This pattern has led to the hypothesis of a sensitive period: a developmental
window during which the brain can map stable categories onto pitches with lasting precision.
[A] If training begins after the window narrows, the brain may still learn to discriminate
pitch, but it may do so relationally rather than categorically.

The tone-language association, however, is not straightforward. Tone languages require
relative pitch patterns across syllables, not the fixed labeling of a piano’s equal-tempered
scale. Moreover, many tone-language speakers do not have absolute pitch, and many absolute-
pitch musicians do not speak tone languages. One plausible bridge is that tone-language
learning trains attention to pitch as a linguistically meaningful feature, making it easier,
under early musical training, to bind pitches to verbal labels. In that view, language does
not implant absolute pitch; it shifts what children attend to while their auditory
categories are forming.

Neuroscience findings add texture. Imaging studies often report that absolute-pitch
musicians show differences in regions associated with auditory perception and labeling,
including asymmetries in the planum temporale. Some studies suggest more efficient links
between auditory representations and verbal memory, consistent with the speed of naming. Yet
neural differences could be both cause and consequence: intensive training itself can
remodel auditory cortex, and people who find pitch labeling easy may practice more. Genetic
factors have been proposed, but no single “absolute pitch gene” has been identified;
instead, the trait likely reflects a combination of predispositions and early environments.

Absolute pitch also has costs. In music that uses tuning systems different from equal
temperament, such as historical temperaments or certain non-Western scales, fixed labeling
can become confusing. A note tuned slightly low may feel “wrong” to an absolute-pitch
listener, even if the ensemble is internally consistent. Some musicians report annoyance
when a piece is transposed, because the expected labels no longer match. Relative pitch, by
contrast, supports transposition naturally because it tracks intervals. [B] Thus, the trait
is not a universal advantage; it is an adaptation to a particular musical culture.

For educators, the implication is pragmatic. Early training and rich musical environments
can nurture categorical pitch memory in some children, yet forcing the skill is unlikely to
work if the sensitive period has passed or if motivation is absent. Moreover, because
musicianship relies heavily on relative pitch, rhythmic skill, and expressive timing,
treating absolute pitch as the apex of talent is misleading. [C] It is one specialized
ability among many, not a guarantee of artistry.

Absolute pitch, then, sits at the intersection of development, attention, and culture. [D]
It reminds researchers that what appears like a mysterious gift may emerge from ordinary
learning mechanisms operating at an extraordinary time.

Because early training matters, many studies compare musicians who began before age six with
those who started later, holding exposure constant.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Early training and rich musical environments can nurture categorical pitch memory in some children, yet forcing the skill is unlikely to work if the sensitive period has passed or if motivation is absent.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across training
   B. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of training
   C. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to absolute and early
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that absolute is often incomplete and concludes that pitch cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since training overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of early with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage surveys pitch but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed early first, with absolute serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats training as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, especially regarding early.
   C. The passage presents early as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once absolute is observed, competing explanations for pitch collapse. It treats training as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   D. The passage explains pitch by linking absolute to early, and it shows why training changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage treats absolute primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over early are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about pitch are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   B. A persuasive account would predict how pitch should change if training is altered, instead of assuming that absolute has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to early must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   C. The passage implies that training mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes absolute effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of early no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain pitch, especially regarding musical, within the passage’s scope, within the passage’s scope.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in training, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of absolute is enough to validate early for pitch.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of training as a factor influencing absolute, especially regarding early.
   B. discussion of stress corrosion cracking as a factor influencing absolute
   C. discussion of early as a factor influencing absolute
   D. discussion of pitch as a factor influencing absolute

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Early training and rich musical environments can nurture categorical pitch memory in some children, yet forcing the skill is unlikely to work if the sensitive period has passed or if motivation is absent.
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear, especially regarding pitch, especially regarding pitch.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. Early training and rich musical environments can nurture categorical pitch memory in some children. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. Early training and rich musical environments can nurture categorical pitch memory in some children. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because absolute directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding pitch.
   B. Because once absolute fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and training can be ignored without changing conclusions about pitch.
   C. Because the presence of early guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in training are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because comparability prevents early from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold training constant while examining absolute.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | absolute | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | training | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves early is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that pitch should be read alongside training, because absolute alone does not settle what early means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This pattern has led to the hypothesis of a sensitive period: a developmental window during which the brain can map stable categories onto pitches with lasting precision.
   A. the preceding claim that pitch functions as a direct measurement of early
   B. the preceding claim that absolute is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   C. the preceding claim that training alone explains the outcome of pitch
   D. the preceding claim about how absolute is interpreted in relation to early

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses early, so debate over absolute is unnecessary noise, as framed by the author.
   B. to show that the term pitch belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of absolute and early should be abandoned altogether.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of absolute lead to different conclusions about pitch.
