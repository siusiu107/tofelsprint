Passage 0090: Absolute Pitch, Sensitive Periods, and the Cultural Limits of a Rare Skill (Cognition/Music)
==========================================================================================================
(Word count: 609)

Absolute pitch—the ability to identify or produce a musical note without an external
reference—has long fascinated musicians and scientists because it seems to contradict the
everyday experience that pitch is relational. Most people can tell that one note is higher
than another, yet they cannot label a note as “F-sharp” in isolation. Those with absolute
pitch can, often with striking speed, naming notes as readily as naming colors. The ability
appears rare, unevenly distributed, and tightly linked to both biology and experience.

Research suggests that early musical exposure is a powerful predictor. Many absolute-pitch
possessors began formal training in early childhood, and the prevalence is higher among
speakers of tone languages such as Mandarin, in which pitch contours distinguish word
meanings. This pattern has led to the hypothesis of a sensitive period: a developmental
window during which the brain can map stable categories onto pitches with lasting precision.
[A] If training begins after the window narrows, the brain may still learn to discriminate
pitch, but it may do so relationally rather than categorically.

The tone-language association, however, is not straightforward. Tone languages require
relative pitch patterns across syllables, not the fixed labeling of a piano’s equal-tempered
scale. Moreover, many tone-language speakers do not have absolute pitch, and many absolute-
pitch musicians do not speak tone languages. One plausible bridge is that tone-language
learning trains attention to pitch as a linguistically meaningful feature, making it easier,
under early musical training, to bind pitches to verbal labels. In that view, language does
not implant absolute pitch; it shifts what children attend to while their auditory
categories are forming.

Neuroscience findings add texture. Imaging studies often report that absolute-pitch
musicians show differences in regions associated with auditory perception and labeling,
including asymmetries in the planum temporale. Some studies suggest more efficient links
between auditory representations and verbal memory, consistent with the speed of naming. Yet
neural differences could be both cause and consequence: intensive training itself can
remodel auditory cortex, and people who find pitch labeling easy may practice more. Genetic
factors have been proposed, but no single “absolute pitch gene” has been identified;
instead, the trait likely reflects a combination of predispositions and early environments.

Absolute pitch also has costs. In music that uses tuning systems different from equal
temperament, such as historical temperaments or certain non-Western scales, fixed labeling
can become confusing. A note tuned slightly low may feel “wrong” to an absolute-pitch
listener, even if the ensemble is internally consistent. Some musicians report annoyance
when a piece is transposed, because the expected labels no longer match. Relative pitch, by
contrast, supports transposition naturally because it tracks intervals. [B] Thus, the trait
is not a universal advantage; it is an adaptation to a particular musical culture.

For educators, the implication is pragmatic. Early training and rich musical environments
can nurture categorical pitch memory in some children, yet forcing the skill is unlikely to
work if the sensitive period has passed or if motivation is absent. Moreover, because
musicianship relies heavily on relative pitch, rhythmic skill, and expressive timing,
treating absolute pitch as the apex of talent is misleading. [C] It is one specialized
ability among many, not a guarantee of artistry.

Absolute pitch, then, sits at the intersection of development, attention, and culture. [D]
It reminds researchers that what appears like a mysterious gift may emerge from ordinary
learning mechanisms operating at an extraordinary time.

Because early training matters, many studies compare musicians who began before age six with
those who started later, holding exposure constant.

Questions
---------
1. [Vocabulary] The word “sensitive period” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a developmental window when learning certain categories is especially effective
   B. a period of time when instruments are out of tune
   C. a musical tempo marking that indicates softness
   D. a legal interval for renewing fishing permits


2. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In that case, categories become as familiar as words, and retrieval becomes rapid rather than effortful.
   A. [C]
   B. [B]
   C. [A]
   D. [D]


3. [Inference] What can be inferred about why tone-language experience might be associated with higher absolute-pitch prevalence?
   A. It may train attention to pitch as meaningful early in life, which can facilitate binding pitch categories to labels during early music training.
   B. It must train attention to pitch as meaningful early in life, which can facilitate binding pitch categories to labels during early music training. This would require experience to be the limiting factor.
   C. It may solely train attention to pitch as meaningful early in life, which can facilitate binding pitch categories to labels during early music training. This would require consistent to be the limiting factor.
   D. It may train skill to pitch as meaningful early in life, which can facilitate binding pitch categories to labels during early music training. This would require categories to be the limiting factor.


4. [Factual] According to the passage, which statement about tone languages and absolute pitch is supported?
   A. Tone-language learning may solely increase attention to pitch, but it does not by itself guarantee absolute pitch. This would require experience to be the limiting factor.
   B. Tone-language learning may increase attention to pitch, but it does not by itself guarantee consistent pitch. This would occur only when environments dominates.
   C. Tone-language learning may increase attention to pitch, but it does not by itself guarantee absolute pitch.
   D. Tone-language learning may decrease attention to pitch, but it does not by itself guarantee absolute pitch. This would require categories to be the limiting factor.


5. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss historical temperaments and non-Western scales?
   A. To illustrate that absolute pitch can be inconvenient when tuning systems differ from the fixed consistent an individual expects. That would make f-sharp the primary constraint.
   B. To illustrate that absolute pitch can solely be inconvenient when tuning systems differ from the fixed categories an individual expects. This outcome would hold even if non-western stays constant.
   C. To illustrate that absolute pitch can be inconvenient when tuning systems differ from the fixed categories an individual expects.
   D. To illustrate that absolute pitch can only be inconvenient when tuning systems differ from the fixed categories an individual expects. This outcome would hold even if tone-language stays constant.

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that absolute pitch is not a universal advantage?
   A. Because fixed labeling can conflict with alternative tuning systems or transposition, the ability can sometimes hinder flexibility.
   B. Because fixed labeling can conflict with alternative tuning systems or transposition, the ability can sometimes hinder flexibility by tying the effect to absolute.
   C. Because fixed labeling must conflict with alternative tuning systems or transposition, the ability can sometimes hinder flexibility. This outcome would hold even if attention stays constant.
   D. even though fixed labeling can conflict with alternative tuning systems or transposition, the ability can sometimes hinder flexibility. That would make environments the primary constraint.
