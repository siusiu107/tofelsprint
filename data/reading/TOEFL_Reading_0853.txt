Passage 0853: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 763)

In cross-site comparisons, the analysis suggests researchers have treated mortality and
phase shifts as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves. To be
sure, photophysiology measurements can make the pattern look unusually sharp, yet the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than
rely on familiar narratives.

the first model can fit one dataset extremely well; still, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how compound
stressors such as acidification and pollution can shift baselines, altering whether
mortality and phase shifts is even comparable across cases, which forces analysts to admit
that means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation. If compound stressors such
as acidification and pollution is changed while the nominal driver remains constant is
granted, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In this sense,
thermal bleaching events is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Using photophysiology measurements under stable conditions, it is difficult to deny that one
frequently cited case from the Great Barrier Reef appeared to support the direct-readout
view. [A] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded.
Although the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that
small shifts in compound stressors such as acidification and pollution altered the baseline
enough to mute or mimic mortality and phase shifts. [B] The author shifts from narrative to
diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, a move that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted. [C] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric
would lead to a different conclusion. [D] The author suggests that the same evidence can
support multiple stories when priors differ.

Not until analysts began combining photophysiology measurements with cross-site comparisons
was it clear that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves stopped relying
on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which mortality and phase shifts could be explained in more than one way in
part because confounders like compound stressors such as acidification and pollution often
co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable. In this sense, loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is the apparent regularity of mortality and phase shifts, which is why
drives the first interpretation: mortality and phase shifts is treated as a direct readout
of mechanism. Provided that mortality and phase shifts is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway, then observations from the Great Barrier Reef would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. Not the caveat that compound stressors such as
acidification and pollution might reproduce the same pattern, but the literature is full of
such claims.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation holds, then the same observation—mortality and phase shifts—must
be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat mortality and phase shifts as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats
it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. In
this sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; still, the
result is a framework in which mortality and phase shifts is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like compound stressors such as acidification and pollution make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting degree-heating-week metrics as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats degree-heating-week metrics as a historical curiosity and does not discuss recruitment failure or compound stressors such as acidification and pollution. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that recruitment failure is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how compound stressors such as acidification and pollution can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Red Sea reefs. Finally, it maintains that tests combining degree-heating-week metrics with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   D. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because recruitment failure uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that compound stressors such as acidification and pollution is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using degree-heating-week metrics are unnecessary.

2. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using symbiont genotyping.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when local adaptation can mimic changes in reef fish assemblages.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving symbiont genotyping.
   D. The author treats the Coral Triangle as a special case and argues that no broader inference about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves is possible.

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The author argues that reef-scale temperature loggers should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The passage implies that Red Sea reefs is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'heat-driven coral whitening' refers to a different field altogether, not to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where reef-scale temperature loggers constrains disease outbreaks

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. changes in reef fish assemblages
   B. a list of Olympic medal counts
   C. Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves
   D. symbiont genotyping

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **persistent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like photophysiology measurements are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because disease outbreaks dominates all evidence
   C. lasting
   D. irrelevant to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves, serving only as background detail

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize confounder control?
   A. The passage implies that degree-heating-week metrics directly measures causes, meaning confounding from shading and cooling refugia is impossible.
   B. it prevents recruitment failure from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control shading and cooling refugia
   C. Since recruitment failure is observed in Red Sea reefs, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because recruitment failure appears, the mechanism must be unique, so shading and cooling refugia can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: it highlights how compound stressors such as acidification and pollution can shift baselines, altering whether mortality and phase shifts is even comparable across cases, which forces analysts to admit that means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifts in carbonate accretion uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on satellite thermal stress maps simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Great Barrier Reef and everywhere else.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates compound stressors such as acidification and pollution.
