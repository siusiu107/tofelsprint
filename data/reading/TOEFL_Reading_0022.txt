Passage 0022: Radiocarbon Calibration, Curve Wiggles, and Hidden Carbon Sources (Archaeology)
=============================================================================================
(Word count: 656)

Radiocarbon dating is often introduced as a straightforward clock: measure how much
carbon‑14 remains in an organic sample, compare it with a known decay rate, and compute how
long ago the organism died. The method is powerful because it converts an invisible isotope
into a quantitative estimate of time. Yet the clock is not perfectly uniform, because the
atmosphere has not contained the same proportion of carbon‑14 in every year. Solar activity,
Earth’s magnetic field, and carbon cycling between ocean and air all influence how much
carbon‑14 is produced and how much is available to plants and animals. As a result, a
radiocarbon “age” must be translated—calibrated—into a calendar age.

Calibration works because some archives record time independently. Tree rings are the best
known. A tree that adds one ring per year can be cross‑dated with others, producing long
sequences that extend thousands of years. If a piece of wood contains a particular ring, and
that ring’s calendar year is known, the carbon‑14 content of that ring becomes a data point:
it reveals the atmospheric carbon‑14 level for that year. By building many such points,
scientists construct a calibration curve that maps radiocarbon ages onto calendar ages.

The curve is not smooth. It contains “wiggles,” intervals in which carbon‑14 levels rose or
fell relatively quickly. These wiggles can complicate dating because a single radiocarbon
measurement may intersect the curve in more than one place, yielding multiple possible
calendar ranges. [A] In effect, the sample’s isotope content may be consistent with two
separate historical windows, and without additional information the method cannot choose
between them. Archaeologists therefore pair radiocarbon data with context: stratigraphy,
artifact styles, or other dates that narrow the plausible range.

Paradoxically, wiggles can also help. In wiggle‑matching, researchers date a sequence of
closely spaced rings from the same timber and compare the pattern of measured radiocarbon
values with the pattern on the curve. A distinctive up‑down signature can anchor the timber
to a specific calendar interval more tightly than a single date could. This is especially
useful for wooden structures, where many adjacent rings are available, and for periods in
which the curve’s wiggles are pronounced.

Another complication is the reservoir effect. Marine organisms can appear “older” than they
are because the ocean mixes surface carbon with deeper water that has been isolated from the
atmosphere for centuries. If a human diet included large amounts of marine food, the carbon
in the person’s bones can inherit this offset, making the individual’s radiocarbon age too
old unless corrected. Lakes can produce similar effects when dissolved ancient carbon enters
the system. [B] The mechanism is again causal: what matters is not the organism’s true
calendar age but the carbon source that fed its body.

Calibration has reshaped archaeological arguments by tightening chronologies and by
revealing that some apparent sequences were compressed. In a site with multiple building
phases, calibrated ranges can show whether two phases were separated by decades or by
centuries. When combined with Bayesian models that incorporate stratigraphic ordering,
calibration can produce probability distributions that reflect both measurement uncertainty
and contextual constraints. This does not turn archaeology into pure mathematics; it
formalizes what archaeologists already do when they ask whether one layer must be older than
another.

The calibrated date, then, is best seen as a constrained estimate rather than as a single
perfect year. [C] It is an argument built from decay physics, atmospheric history, and site
context. When those components align, radiocarbon dating can place human activity onto an
absolute timeline with remarkable precision. When they conflict, the conflict itself can
expose hidden complexities—mixed deposits, old wood reused in later buildings, or diets that
drew carbon from unexpected reservoirs. [D] In that way, calibration does not merely correct
radiocarbon; it makes time visible as a layered record of both nature and human behavior.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: If a piece of wood contains a particular ring, and that ring’s calendar year is known, the carbon‑14 content of that ring becomes a data point: it reveals the atmospheric carbon‑14 level for that year.
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across calibration
   C. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to radiocarbon and calendar
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of calibration

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents calendar as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once radiocarbon is observed, competing explanations for carbon collapse. It treats calibration as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   B. The passage concedes that radiocarbon is often incomplete and concludes that carbon cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since calibration overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of calendar with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   C. The passage surveys carbon but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed calendar first, with radiocarbon serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats calibration as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, under the stated assumptions.
   D. The passage explains carbon by linking radiocarbon to calendar, and it shows why calibration changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how carbon should change if calibration is altered, instead of assuming that radiocarbon has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to calendar must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage treats radiocarbon primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over calendar are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about carbon are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. The passage implies that calibration mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes radiocarbon effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of calendar no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain carbon, in the setting discussed, in the context of the passage.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in calibration, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of radiocarbon is enough to validate calendar for carbon.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of calibration as a factor influencing radiocarbon
   B. discussion of radiocarbon reservoir effects as a factor influencing radiocarbon
   C. discussion of carbon as a factor influencing radiocarbon, especially regarding wiggles.
   D. discussion of calendar as a factor influencing radiocarbon

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: If a piece of wood contains a particular ring, and that ring’s calendar year is known, the carbon‑14 content of that ring becomes a data point: it reveals the atmospheric carbon‑14 level for that year.
   A. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   C. If a piece of wood contains a particular ring. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   D. If a piece of wood contains a particular ring. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because radiocarbon directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding carbon.
   B. Because comparability prevents calendar from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold calibration constant while examining radiocarbon.
   C. Because the presence of calendar guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in calibration are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because once radiocarbon fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and calibration can be ignored without changing conclusions about carbon.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | radiocarbon | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | calibration | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It proves calendar is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that carbon should be read alongside calibration, because radiocarbon alone does not settle what calendar means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This is especially useful for wooden structures, where many adjacent rings are available, and for periods in which the curve’s wiggles are pronounced.
   A. the idea that Another complication is the reservoir effect, in the examples provided, as framed by the author, in the cases described.
   B. the idea that A distinctive up‑down signature can anchor the timber to a specific calendar interval more tightly than a single date could
   C. the idea that In wiggle‑matching, researchers date a sequence of closely spaced rings from the same timber and compare the pattern of measured radiocarbon values with the...
   D. the idea that If a piece of wood contains a particular ring, and that ring’s calendar year is known, the carbon‑14 content of that ring becomes a...
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of radiocarbon and calendar should be abandoned altogether.
   B. to show that the term carbon belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses calendar, so debate over radiocarbon is unnecessary noise, in the context of the passage.
   D. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of radiocarbon lead to different conclusions about carbon.
