Passage 0022: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 652)

In comparative migration studies, one sees why researchers have treated political
realignment patterns as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern urban
transformation. Despite the fact that housing record reconstruction can make the pattern
look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

To be sure, the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, yet the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. [A] The author uses the example to
separate detection from interpretation. it highlights how wartime industry demand can shift
baselines, altering whether political realignment patterns is even comparable across cases;
this, in turn, means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation. [B] The passage
emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating them as afterthoughts. If wartime
industry demand is changed while the nominal driver remains constant is granted, one should
expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. [C] This reasoning matters because
it changes what counts as a decisive test. [D] The author treats this as a clue rather than
as a nuisance. In this sense, african american internal migration is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify wartime industry demand
could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which housing record reconstruction constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move from description
to explanation, then the same observation—political realignment patterns—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
political realignment patterns as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts. In this sense, south-to-north population
movement is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only through analysts began combining housing record reconstruction with cross-site
comparisons could one reasonably claim that claims about the great migration and northern
urban transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which political realignment patterns
could be explained in more than one way in part because confounders like wartime industry
demand often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became
an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether
two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban
transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without
implying that any story is arbitrary. Admittedly, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a
definitive answer is strong; nevertheless, the result is a framework in which political
realignment patterns is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through
habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. a recipe for bread fermentation
   B. housing record reconstruction
   C. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   D. political realignment patterns

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **ambiguous** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Whereas popular summaries treat political realignment patterns as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because housing covenants and policy constraints dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   C. unclear
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like housing record reconstruction are needed

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In other words, the disagreement is not about whether the data exist, but about what the data are evidence for.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The passage implies that Harlem is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author argues that oral history synthesis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'African American internal migration' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where oral history synthesis constrains push–pull dynamics

5. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. Because political realignment patterns appears, the mechanism must be unique, so racial violence and intimidation can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if housing record reconstruction produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. The passage implies that housing record reconstruction directly measures causes, meaning confounding from racial violence and intimidation is impossible.
   D. it prevents political realignment patterns from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control racial violence and intimidation

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Chicago and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on labor market inference from wage series simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates wartime industry demand.

7. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when housing covenants and policy constraints can mimic segregation and redlining signatures.
   B. The author treats Harlem as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away housing covenants and policy constraints, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving newspaper archive research.

8. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | labor market inference from wage series | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | political realignment patterns | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | racial violence and intimidation | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It proves changes in neighborhood composition is unique.
   B. Depends on modeling priors
   C. It replaces census microdata analysis with intuition.
   D. Shifts the baseline

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. political realignment patterns specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. housing covenants and policy constraints alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. newspaper archive research as a device rather than as an analytic approach

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like housing covenants and policy constraints make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting census microdata analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that segregation and redlining signatures is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how housing covenants and policy constraints can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Detroit. Finally, it maintains that tests combining census microdata analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats census microdata analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss segregation and redlining signatures or housing covenants and policy constraints. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because segregation and redlining signatures uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that housing covenants and policy constraints is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using census microdata analysis are unnecessary.
