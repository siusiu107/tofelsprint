Passage 0022: Radiocarbon Calibration, Curve Wiggles, and Hidden Carbon Sources (Archaeology)
=============================================================================================
(Word count: 656)

Radiocarbon dating is often introduced as a straightforward clock: measure how much
carbon‑14 remains in an organic sample, compare it with a known decay rate, and compute how
long ago the organism died. The method is powerful because it converts an invisible isotope
into a quantitative estimate of time. Yet the clock is not perfectly uniform, because the
atmosphere has not contained the same proportion of carbon‑14 in every year. Solar activity,
Earth’s magnetic field, and carbon cycling between ocean and air all influence how much
carbon‑14 is produced and how much is available to plants and animals. As a result, a
radiocarbon “age” must be translated—calibrated—into a calendar age.

Calibration works because some archives record time independently. Tree rings are the best
known. A tree that adds one ring per year can be cross‑dated with others, producing long
sequences that extend thousands of years. If a piece of wood contains a particular ring, and
that ring’s calendar year is known, the carbon‑14 content of that ring becomes a data point:
it reveals the atmospheric carbon‑14 level for that year. By building many such points,
scientists construct a calibration curve that maps radiocarbon ages onto calendar ages.

The curve is not smooth. It contains “wiggles,” intervals in which carbon‑14 levels rose or
fell relatively quickly. These wiggles can complicate dating because a single radiocarbon
measurement may intersect the curve in more than one place, yielding multiple possible
calendar ranges. [A] In effect, the sample’s isotope content may be consistent with two
separate historical windows, and without additional information the method cannot choose
between them. Archaeologists therefore pair radiocarbon data with context: stratigraphy,
artifact styles, or other dates that narrow the plausible range.

Paradoxically, wiggles can also help. In wiggle‑matching, researchers date a sequence of
closely spaced rings from the same timber and compare the pattern of measured radiocarbon
values with the pattern on the curve. A distinctive up‑down signature can anchor the timber
to a specific calendar interval more tightly than a single date could. This is especially
useful for wooden structures, where many adjacent rings are available, and for periods in
which the curve’s wiggles are pronounced.

Another complication is the reservoir effect. Marine organisms can appear “older” than they
are because the ocean mixes surface carbon with deeper water that has been isolated from the
atmosphere for centuries. If a human diet included large amounts of marine food, the carbon
in the person’s bones can inherit this offset, making the individual’s radiocarbon age too
old unless corrected. Lakes can produce similar effects when dissolved ancient carbon enters
the system. [B] The mechanism is again causal: what matters is not the organism’s true
calendar age but the carbon source that fed its body.

Calibration has reshaped archaeological arguments by tightening chronologies and by
revealing that some apparent sequences were compressed. In a site with multiple building
phases, calibrated ranges can show whether two phases were separated by decades or by
centuries. When combined with Bayesian models that incorporate stratigraphic ordering,
calibration can produce probability distributions that reflect both measurement uncertainty
and contextual constraints. This does not turn archaeology into pure mathematics; it
formalizes what archaeologists already do when they ask whether one layer must be older than
another.

The calibrated date, then, is best seen as a constrained estimate rather than as a single
perfect year. [C] It is an argument built from decay physics, atmospheric history, and site
context. When those components align, radiocarbon dating can place human activity onto an
absolute timeline with remarkable precision. When they conflict, the conflict itself can
expose hidden complexities—mixed deposits, old wood reused in later buildings, or diets that
drew carbon from unexpected reservoirs. [D] In that way, calibration does not merely correct
radiocarbon; it makes time visible as a layered record of both nature and human behavior.


Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author emphasize that atmospheric carbon‑14 levels changed over time?
   A. To explain why radiocarbon ages require calibration to become calendar ages
   B. To argue that decay rates are unknown
   C. To claim that tree rings cannot be dated
   D. To suggest that marine foods contain no carbon

2. [Vocabulary] The word “wiggles” in the passage refers to:
   A. rapid fluctuations in the calibration curve
   B. errors caused by broken lab equipment
   C. rings added twice per year
   D. sediments sliding downhill

3. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This is why two archaeologists can report the same radiocarbon measurement yet propose different calendar interpretations.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Factual] According to the passage, how do tree rings support calibration?
   A. They provide independently dated yearly records whose carbon‑14 content reveals past atmospheric levels
   B. They speed up carbon decay in wood
   C. They erase reservoir effects in marine shells
   D. They guarantee a smooth calibration curve with no fluctuations

5. [Inference] What can be inferred about why wiggle‑matching can outperform a single radiocarbon date?
   A. A sequence of adjacent rings can match a distinctive fluctuation pattern, anchoring the timber to a narrower interval
   B. Multiple measurements always eliminate lab uncertainty entirely
   C. Wiggle‑matching changes the decay rate to fit the curve
   D. A single date is useless whenever wood is present

6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as causes of dating offsets EXCEPT:
   A. marine reservoir effects
   B. lake systems with ancient dissolved carbon
   C. reused old wood in later structures
   D. planetary rings changing isotope ratios

7. [Reference] In the passage, “this offset” refers to:
   A. the tendency for marine-derived carbon to make radiocarbon ages appear too old
   B. the distance between trees in a forest
   C. the number of wiggles in the curve
   D. the thickness of an artifact layer

8. [Organization] How is the passage organized?
   A. It introduces the radiocarbon clock, explains calibration via independent archives, then discusses wiggles and reservoir effects before describing how calibrated chronologies shape interpretation
   B. It lists excavation tools only
   C. It narrates a single shipwreck without discussing time
   D. It focuses solely on Bayesian statistics without explaining carbon

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that a calibrated date is “a constrained estimate”?
   A. It is a probabilistic time range shaped by measurement, atmospheric history, and archaeological context
   B. It is a single exact year guaranteed by decay physics alone
   C. It is an opinion unrelated to evidence
   D. It is a number chosen to fit artifact styles

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Radiocarbon dating yields exact calendar years without correction because the atmosphere never changes.
   B. The passage explains that radiocarbon ages must be calibrated because past carbon‑14 levels varied, that curve fluctuations can both complicate and aid dating through wiggle‑matching, and that reservoir effects and context-sensitive models influence how archaeological chronologies are built.
   C. Tree rings are unreliable because they do not record carbon‑14.
   D. Reservoir effects occur only in deserts and have no archaeological relevance.
