Passage 0620: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 705)

From an observational standpoint, the analysis suggests researchers have treated rotation-
modulated light curves as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy. Granted that chromatic transit analysis can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather
than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were
applied in settings unlike multi-epoch JWST targets. the same summary statistic could be
reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because limb-darkening model mismatch
shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. Rather than treating rotation-
modulated light curves as a self-sufficient conclusion, the passage emphasizes that the
author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense, unocculted
spot/facula bias in transit data is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. [A] The author uses the example to
separate detection from interpretation. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—rotation-modulated
light curves—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
[B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
Whereas popular summaries treat rotation-modulated light curves as an endpoint, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. [C] The
passage highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. [D] This is why
the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is inferred.

The point is not X but the apparent regularity of rotation-modulated light curves; in that
framing, drives the first interpretation: rotation-modulated light curves is treated as a
direct readout of mechanism. Should rotation-modulated light curves is uniquely produced by
one causal pathway be true, then observations from multi-epoch JWST targets would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. Rather than the caveat that limb-
darkening model mismatch might reproduce the same pattern, the passage emphasizes that the
literature is full of such claims. In this sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from description to
explanation to fail, then the same observation—rotation-modulated light curves—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular
summaries treat rotation-modulated light curves as an endpoint in one account, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in
another.

Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify limb-darkening model mismatch
did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which chromatic transit analysis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, which is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Though a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In
this sense, photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome
that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any
story is arbitrary. the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong;
still, the result is a framework in which rotation-modulated light curves is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This point matters because the simplest interpretation often survives only by silently restricting the range of cases under discussion.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The author argues that chromatic transit analysis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'photospheric contamination of transmission spectra' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
   C. The passage treats time-variable spectral baselines as a confounder and instrument drift across visits as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where chromatic transit analysis constrains instrument drift across visits

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like instrument drift across visits make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting spot–facular forward modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that time-variable spectral baselines is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how instrument drift across visits can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from active K-dwarf host stars. Finally, it maintains that tests combining spot–facular forward modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats spot–facular forward modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss time-variable spectral baselines or instrument drift across visits. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that instrument drift across visits is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using spot–facular forward modeling are unnecessary.

4. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. Because limb-darkening model mismatch co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents time-variable spectral baselines from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control limb-darkening model mismatch
   C. Since time-variable spectral baselines is observed in M-dwarf systems with repeated transits, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if simultaneous photometric monitoring produces a tight fit on one dataset.

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats active K-dwarf host stars as a special case and argues that no broader inference about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy is possible.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facula coverage fractions can mimic rotation-modulated light curves.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away facula coverage fractions, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The passage suggests that rotation-modulated light curves is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
