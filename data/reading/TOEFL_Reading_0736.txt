Passage 0736: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 738)

In twentieth-century urban histories, the analysis suggests researchers have treated
political realignment patterns as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern
urban transformation. labor market inference from wage series can make the pattern look
unusually sharp; still, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify push–pull dynamics could
one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which labor market inference from wage series constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn,
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even though a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, african american internal
migration is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on push–pull dynamics, the passage suggests
many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban transformation as a single-
mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized political realignment patterns as a
signature may be convenient, later work asked whether the same signature survives when
protocols and baselines differ is scientifically revealing. this shift mattered for how
evidence from Chicago was generalized in part because local conditions can change which
processes generate political realignment patterns.

Using labor market inference from wage series under stable conditions, the author treats the
complication as diagnostic, so one frequently cited case from Chicago appeared to support
the direct-readout view. While it is true that the original fit looked visually decisive,
later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in push–pull dynamics altered the
baseline enough to mute or mimic political realignment patterns. the passage treats this
episode as diagnostic; this, in turn, illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by
what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move from description
to explanation, then the same observation—political realignment patterns—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
political realignment patterns as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

Rarely, unless analysts began combining labor market inference from wage series with cross-
site comparisons, does one see why claims about the great migration and northern urban
transformation stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions. [A] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data
cannot rule out. the goal was to break degeneracies in which political realignment patterns
could be explained in more than one way because confounders like push–pull dynamics often
co-vary with the driver. [B] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable. [C] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts
as a decisive test. [D] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows.
In this sense, twentieth-century black migration flows is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. While it is
true that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result
is a framework in which political realignment patterns is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **degenerate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like newspaper archive research are needed
   B. not uniquely determined
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because wartime industry demand dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. newspaper archive research
   B. shifts in industrial labor demand
   C. a recipe for bread fermentation
   D. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The passage implies that Detroit is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where census microdata analysis constrains wartime industry demand
   C. The discussion suggests that wartime industry demand is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The passage treats segregation and redlining signatures as a confounder and wartime industry demand as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

4. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. The passage implies that housing record reconstruction directly measures causes, meaning confounding from wartime industry demand is impossible.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if housing record reconstruction produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. it prevents political realignment patterns from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control wartime industry demand
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once political realignment patterns is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage suggests that changes in neighborhood composition is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away housing covenants and policy constraints, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving newspaper archive research.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when housing covenants and policy constraints can mimic changes in neighborhood composition.

6. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | newspaper archive research | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | segregation and redlining signatures | Can be degenerate with another effect |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Co-varies with the driver of interest
   B. Can introduce systematic bias
   C. It replaces labor market inference from wage series with intuition.
   D. It makes push–pull dynamics irrelevant.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Philadelphia and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on oral history synthesis simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates racial violence and intimidation.

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like housing covenants and policy constraints make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting oral history synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that housing covenants and policy constraints is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using oral history synthesis are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats oral history synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifts in industrial labor demand or housing covenants and policy constraints. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that shifts in industrial labor demand is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how housing covenants and policy constraints can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Harlem. Finally, it maintains that tests combining oral history synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. housing covenants and policy constraints alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. shifts in industrial labor demand specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. housing record reconstruction as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]
