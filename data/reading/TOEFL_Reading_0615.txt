Passage 0615: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 758)

Under multi-epoch monitoring, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated rotation-
modulated light curves as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy. Though multi-epoch transit campaigns can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather
than rely on familiar narratives.

Even if the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. [A] The author implies that
replication is informative only when protocols are comparable. it highlights how instrument
drift across visits can shift baselines, altering whether rotation-modulated light curves is
even comparable across cases; this, in turn, means that a good fit is not the same as a good
explanation. [B] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data
cannot rule out. Unless instrument drift across visits is changed while the nominal driver
remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed cannot
be claimed with confidence. [C] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author
frames it as conditional. [D] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating
them as afterthoughts. In this sense, unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on instrument drift across visits, the
author treats the complication as diagnostic, so many early studies framed stellar
contamination in transit spectroscopy as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those
studies emphasized rotation-modulated light curves as a signature in one account, later work
asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ in another.
this shift mattered for how evidence from bright nearby planet hosts was generalized because
local conditions can change which processes generate rotation-modulated light curves, which
is why replication matters.

Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify instrument drift across visits
did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which multi-epoch transit campaigns constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be dramatic, the
author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. In this sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—rotation-modulated light curves—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence.
Whereas popular summaries treat rotation-modulated light curves as an endpoint in one
account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts in another.

Only after analysts began combining multi-epoch transit campaigns with cross-site
comparisons did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about stellar
contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying on a single figure and started relying
on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which rotation-modulated
light curves could be explained in more than one way because confounders like instrument
drift across visits often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice; this, in turn, changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense,
photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which
helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying
that any story is arbitrary. To be sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive
answer is strong, yet the result is a framework in which rotation-modulated light curves is
interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which helps explain why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on spot–facular forward modeling simple.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because rotation-modulated light curves uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates facula coverage fractions.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | spot–facular forward modeling | Samples only part of the system |

   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once spurious molecular detections is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. it prevents spurious molecular detections from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control facula coverage fractions
   D. Because facula coverage fractions co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

10. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats chromatic transit analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss time-variable spectral baselines or instrument drift across visits. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like instrument drift across visits make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting chromatic transit analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that time-variable spectral baselines is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how instrument drift across visits can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from M-dwarf systems with repeated transits. Finally, it maintains that tests combining chromatic transit analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   D. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that instrument drift across visits is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using chromatic transit analysis are unnecessary.
