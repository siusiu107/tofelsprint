Passage 0618: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 670)

In large-scale platform studies, the analysis suggests researchers have treated school-
quality gradients as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality. Admittedly, audit studies in housing markets can make the pattern
look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional
and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data
collection than about what the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to
move from description to explanation, then the same observation—school-quality
gradients—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot
be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat school-quality gradients as an
endpoint looks decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental
or observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. In this sense, spatial
stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on informational asymmetries in housing
search, the passage suggests many early studies framed residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality as a single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] Later
comparisons reveal why this matters. Whereas those studies emphasized school-quality
gradients as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under replication. [B]
The author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen case. this
shift mattered for how evidence from post-industrial cities was generalized largely because
local conditions can change which processes generate school-quality gradients. [C] The
author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. [D]
The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism.

Only after analysts began combining audit studies in housing markets with cross-site
comparisons did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so claims about
residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a
single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which school-quality gradients could be explained in more than one way
because confounders like informational asymmetries in housing search often co-vary with the
driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than
a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Despite the fact that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
informational asymmetries in housing search can shift baselines, altering whether school-
quality gradients is even comparable across cases, which forces analysts to admit that means
that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation. If informational asymmetries in
housing search is changed while the nominal driver remains constant is granted, one should
expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In this sense, persistent
neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in
turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any
story is arbitrary. To be sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer
is strong, yet the result is a framework in which school-quality gradients is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where spatial autocorrelation analysis constrains informational asymmetries in housing search
   B. The passage implies that rapidly growing Sun Belt regions is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The passage treats mobility constraints across space as a confounder and informational asymmetries in housing search as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The discussion suggests that informational asymmetries in housing search is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

2. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that disparate exposure to pollution is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using longitudinal panel data.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when informational asymmetries in housing search can mimic disparate exposure to pollution.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away informational asymmetries in housing search, since variability is merely a measurement error.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats mobility tracking with administrative records as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or credit market discrimination. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that credit market discrimination is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using mobility tracking with administrative records are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like credit market discrimination make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting mobility tracking with administrative records as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how credit market discrimination can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from large U.S. metropolitan areas. Finally, it maintains that tests combining mobility tracking with administrative records with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality

   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because credit market discrimination dominates all evidence
   B. not certain
   C. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like spatial autocorrelation analysis are needed

7. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize confounder control?
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if spatial autocorrelation analysis produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. The passage implies that spatial autocorrelation analysis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from credit market discrimination is impossible.
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once mobility constraints across space is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. it prevents mobility constraints across space from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control credit market discrimination
