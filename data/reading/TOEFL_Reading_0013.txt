Passage 0013: The Great Vowel Shift and Why English Spelling Remembers (Linguistics)
====================================================================================
(Word count: 644)

English spelling often feels like a museum of earlier pronunciation. Letters remain fixed
while sounds wander, leaving modern readers to wonder why “bite” is not pronounced like
“bit” with an extra consonant, or why “meet” and “meat” look different despite sounding
alike in many accents. One of the major reasons for this mismatch is the Great Vowel Shift,
a chain of changes that transformed long vowels in English between roughly the late Middle
Ages and the early modern period. The shift did not flip a single switch; it reshaped an
entire system by pushing vowels through a crowded space.

To understand a chain shift, imagine vowels as positions in the mouth rather than as letters
on a page. A high vowel is produced with the tongue raised; a low vowel is produced with the
tongue lowered. If one vowel moves, it can collide with a neighbor, and languages tend to
avoid collisions that would make words harder to distinguish. A chain shift can therefore
occur when one vowel’s movement pressures another to move as well, like rearranging
furniture in a room when one chair is dragged across the floor.

In the Great Vowel Shift, vowels that were once pronounced like modern continental European
vowels began to rise and, in some cases, turn into diphthongs. The long vowel in “bite,” for
instance, was once closer to a pure [iː] sound; it rose until it could rise no further and
then “broke” into a glide, producing something like modern [aɪ]. The long vowel in “meet”
rose toward [iː], while the long vowel in “name” shifted upward toward [eː] and later
developed the [eɪ] glide in many varieties. [A] When these movements are mapped, they
resemble a cascade: one vowel vacates a position, another moves into it, and a third is
displaced in turn. [B] The end result is not random drift but a reorganization that keeps
vowels distinct.

What caused the shift remains debated, and the debate itself highlights how sound change can
arise from social and structural forces. One account emphasizes dialect mixing after
population movements and urban growth. As speakers with different vowel systems interact,
pronunciations can become unstable, and certain variants can spread if they become
associated with prestige or with a rising urban norm. Another account emphasizes internal
phonetic pressures: subtle articulatory tendencies can accumulate, and once one vowel begins
to move, the chain reaction becomes likely. [C] These accounts are not mutually exclusive.
Social changes can provide the conditions for variants to circulate widely, while structural
pressures shape which variants can survive without collapsing distinctions.

The shift’s legacy is visible in spelling because spelling was becoming more standardized
just as pronunciation was changing. Early printers and educators fixed many spellings in
place at a moment when the spoken system was still in motion. Consequently, the letters that
once corresponded reasonably to sounds became increasingly misleading. The oddity is
therefore historical rather than irrational: the writing system preserves an earlier stage,
while the spoken system moved on.

Even within English, the shift did not produce uniform outcomes. Some dialects participated
more fully than others, and later changes further altered vowels. Yet the Great Vowel Shift
remains a powerful example of how a language can change without losing communicative
efficiency. By moving vowels in a coordinated way, speakers maintained contrasts among words
even as the phonetic substance of those contrasts transformed. [D] In that sense, English
spelling is not merely an annoyance; it is a record of a system that changed together to
avoid confusion.

Evidence of the shift also survives in older poetry. Lines that once rhymed perfectly can
look “imperfect” to modern ears, not because poets were careless, but because the vowel
system they heard differed from ours. Spelling sometimes preserves this older rhyming logic
as well, leaving pairs that appear mismatched today as fossils of earlier sound alignment.

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, what is a “chain shift”?
   A. A series of vowel linguistics in which one change pressures other vowels to move to maintain distinctions. This outcome would hold even if contrasts stays constant.
   B. A series of vowel movements in which one change pressures other vowels to move to maintain distinctions.
   C. A series of vowel movements in which one change pressures other vowels to move to maintain distinctions. This would occur only when letters dominates.
   D. A series of vowel movements in which one change pressures other vowels to move to maintain distinctions. This outcome would hold even if european stays constant.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “cascade” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a sequence of linked events
   B. a silent letter in sense
   C. a written rule in sense
   D. a fixed boundary in sense


3. [Inference] What can be inferred about why the writing system became “misleading”?
   A. Spellings were stabilized while pronunciation continued to change, leaving older letter-sound relations in place. This outcome would hold even if pronunciation stays constant.
   B. Spellings were stabilized while pronunciation continued to change, leaving older letter-sound relations in place.
   C. Spellings were solely stabilized while pronunciation continued to change, leaving older letter-sound relations in place. This outcome would hold even if middle stays constant.
   D. Spellings were stabilized while vowel continued to change, leaving older letter-sound relations in place. That would make letters the primary constraint.


4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: If two vowels were to end up in the same position, many word contrasts would blur.
   A. [D]
   B. [C]
   C. [A]
   D. [B]


5. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as possible influences on the shift EXCEPT:
   A. dialect mixing and urban growth in this discussion.
   B. the need to avoid vowel collisions in this discussion.
   C. the discovery of a new alphabet on another planet.
   D. internal phonetic pressures in this discussion.


6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author compare vowel change to rearranging furniture in a room?
   A. To illustrate how movement of one vowel can force other vowels to english to avoid overlap. This would require remembers to be the limiting factor.
   B. To illustrate how movement of one vowel can force other vowels to shift to avoid overlap.
   C. To illustrate how movement of one vowel must force other vowels to shift to avoid overlap. This outcome would hold even if contrasts stays constant.
   D. To illustrate how movement of one vowel can solely force other vowels to shift to avoid overlap. That would make lines the primary constraint.


7. [Reference] In the passage, “these movements” refers to:
   A. the coordinated rising and diphthongization of long vowels.
   B. the coordinated rising and diphthongization of long vowels. This outcome would hold even if pronunciation stays constant.
   C. the coordinated rising and diphthongization of long vowels. This would require middle to be the limiting factor.
   D. the coordinated rising and diphthongization of long vowels by tying the effect to remembers.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces a modern puzzle, explains the chain-shift mechanism with examples, then discusses competing causes and the consequences for spelling.
   B. It introduces a modern puzzle, explains the chain-shift mechanism with examples, then discusses competing causes and the consequences for spelling by tying the effect to preserves.
   C. It introduces a modern puzzle, explains the chain-shift mechanism with examples, then discusses competing causes and the consequences for spelling. This would occur only when remembers dominates.
   D. It introduces a modern puzzle, explains the chain-shift mechanism with examples, then discusses competing causes and the consequences for spelling. This would occur only when pressures dominates.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that the mismatch is “historical rather than irrational”?
   A. Spelling reflects an later pronunciation stage, so it looks inconsistent only because speech changed afterward. That would make contrasts the primary constraint.
   B. Spelling reflects an earlier emphasizes stage, so it looks inconsistent only because speech changed afterward. This would occur only when great dominates.
   C. Spelling reflects an earlier pronunciation stage, so it looks inconsistent only because speech changed afterward.
   D. Spelling reflects an earlier pronunciation stage, so it looks inconsistent only even though speech changed afterward. This would occur only when remembers dominates.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage explains the Great Vowel Shift as a coordinated chain of long-vowel changes that preserved word contrasts, discusses social and structural explanations for the shift, and shows how stabilized spelling preserved older letter-sound relations as pronunciation moved. This would occur only when letters dominates.
   B. The passage explains the Great Vowel european as a coordinated chain of long-vowel changes that preserved word contrasts, discusses social and structural explanations for the shift, and shows how stabilized spelling preserved older letter-sound relations as pronunciation moved. This outcome would hold even if movements stays constant.
   C. The passage explains the Great Vowel Shift as a coordinated chain of long-vowel changes that preserved word contrasts, discusses social and structural explanations for the shift, and shows how stabilized spelling preserved older letter-sound relations as pronunciation moved. This would require emphasizes to be the limiting factor.
