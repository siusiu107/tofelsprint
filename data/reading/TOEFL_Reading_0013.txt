Passage 0013: The Great Vowel Shift and Why English Spelling Remembers (Linguistics)
====================================================================================
(Word count: 644)

English spelling often feels like a museum of earlier pronunciation. Letters remain fixed
while sounds wander, leaving modern readers to wonder why “bite” is not pronounced like
“bit” with an extra consonant, or why “meet” and “meat” look different despite sounding
alike in many accents. One of the major reasons for this mismatch is the Great Vowel Shift,
a chain of changes that transformed long vowels in English between roughly the late Middle
Ages and the early modern period. The shift did not flip a single switch; it reshaped an
entire system by pushing vowels through a crowded space.

To understand a chain shift, imagine vowels as positions in the mouth rather than as letters
on a page. A high vowel is produced with the tongue raised; a low vowel is produced with the
tongue lowered. If one vowel moves, it can collide with a neighbor, and languages tend to
avoid collisions that would make words harder to distinguish. A chain shift can therefore
occur when one vowel’s movement pressures another to move as well, like rearranging
furniture in a room when one chair is dragged across the floor.

In the Great Vowel Shift, vowels that were once pronounced like modern continental European
vowels began to rise and, in some cases, turn into diphthongs. The long vowel in “bite,” for
instance, was once closer to a pure [iː] sound; it rose until it could rise no further and
then “broke” into a glide, producing something like modern [aɪ]. The long vowel in “meet”
rose toward [iː], while the long vowel in “name” shifted upward toward [eː] and later
developed the [eɪ] glide in many varieties. [A] When these movements are mapped, they
resemble a cascade: one vowel vacates a position, another moves into it, and a third is
displaced in turn. [B] The end result is not random drift but a reorganization that keeps
vowels distinct.

What caused the shift remains debated, and the debate itself highlights how sound change can
arise from social and structural forces. One account emphasizes dialect mixing after
population movements and urban growth. As speakers with different vowel systems interact,
pronunciations can become unstable, and certain variants can spread if they become
associated with prestige or with a rising urban norm. Another account emphasizes internal
phonetic pressures: subtle articulatory tendencies can accumulate, and once one vowel begins
to move, the chain reaction becomes likely. [C] These accounts are not mutually exclusive.
Social changes can provide the conditions for variants to circulate widely, while structural
pressures shape which variants can survive without collapsing distinctions.

The shift’s legacy is visible in spelling because spelling was becoming more standardized
just as pronunciation was changing. Early printers and educators fixed many spellings in
place at a moment when the spoken system was still in motion. Consequently, the letters that
once corresponded reasonably to sounds became increasingly misleading. The oddity is
therefore historical rather than irrational: the writing system preserves an earlier stage,
while the spoken system moved on.

Even within English, the shift did not produce uniform outcomes. Some dialects participated
more fully than others, and later changes further altered vowels. Yet the Great Vowel Shift
remains a powerful example of how a language can change without losing communicative
efficiency. By moving vowels in a coordinated way, speakers maintained contrasts among words
even as the phonetic substance of those contrasts transformed. [D] In that sense, English
spelling is not merely an annoyance; it is a record of a system that changed together to
avoid confusion.

Evidence of the shift also survives in older poetry. Lines that once rhymed perfectly can
look “imperfect” to modern ears, not because poets were careless, but because the vowel
system they heard differed from ours. Spelling sometimes preserves this older rhyming logic
as well, leaving pairs that appear mismatched today as fossils of earlier sound alignment.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Letters remain fixed while sounds wander, leaving modern readers to wonder why “bite” is not pronounced like “bit” with an extra consonant, or why “meet” and “meat” look different despite sounding alike in many accents.
   A. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of system
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to shift and vowels
   C. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across system
   D. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage explains vowel by linking shift to vowels, and it shows why system changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   B. The passage concedes that shift is often incomplete and concludes that vowel cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since system overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of vowels with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, in the examples provided.
   C. The passage surveys vowel but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed vowels first, with shift serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats system as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   D. The passage presents vowels as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once shift is observed, competing explanations for vowel collapse. It treats system as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage treats shift primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over vowels are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about vowel are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   B. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in system, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of shift is enough to validate vowels for vowel.
   C. The passage implies that system mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes shift effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of vowels no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain vowel, in the setting discussed, in the setting discussed, especially regarding shift.
   D. A persuasive account would predict how vowel should change if system is altered, instead of assuming that shift has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to vowels must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of system as a factor influencing shift
   B. discussion of contact-zone multilingualism as a factor influencing shift
   C. discussion of vowels as a factor influencing shift
   D. discussion of vowel as a factor influencing shift, especially regarding vowels.

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Letters remain fixed while sounds wander, leaving modern readers to wonder why “bite” is not pronounced like “bit” with an extra consonant, or why “meet” and “meat” look different despite sounding alike in many accents.
   A. Letters remain fixed while sounds wander. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   C. Letters remain fixed while sounds wander. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because shift directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding vowel.
   B. Because once shift fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and system can be ignored without changing conclusions about vowel.
   C. Because comparability prevents vowels from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold system constant while examining shift.
   D. Because the presence of vowels guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in system are merely stylistic noise.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | shift | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | system | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves vowels is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   B. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that vowel should be read alongside system, because shift alone does not settle what vowels means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] These accounts are not mutually exclusive.
   A. the preceding claim that system alone explains the outcome of vowel
   B. the preceding claim that vowel functions as a direct measurement of vowels
   C. the preceding claim about how shift is interpreted in relation to vowels
   D. the preceding claim that shift is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term vowel belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of shift lead to different conclusions about vowel.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses vowels, so debate over shift is unnecessary noise, in the context of the passage.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of shift and vowels should be abandoned altogether.
