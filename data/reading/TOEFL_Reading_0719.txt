Passage 0719: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 752)

When adoption is measured in aggregates, the passage argues that researchers have treated
wealth accumulation gaps as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the persistence
of neighborhood inequality. Though mobility tracking with administrative records can make
the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent
consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike large U.S.
metropolitan areas. the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying
mechanisms differed largely because zoning rules and land-use regulation shifted the
baseline in different directions across sites. So the author therefore separates detection
from interpretation, and so, too, does the evidence undermine treating wealth accumulation
gaps as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, spatial stratification in cities is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify zoning rules and land-use
regulation could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically productive rather
than merely rhetorical. [A] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. by
comparing cases in which mobility tracking with administrative records constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, something that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author
uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion. a
single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative. [C] That point is not rhetorical; it
controls which prediction follows. [D] The passage emphasizes boundary conditions instead of
treating them as afterthoughts.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move
from description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same
observation—wealth accumulation gaps—must be paired with tests that change the conditions
under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat wealth accumulation gaps as an
endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental
or observational contrasts in another. In this sense, segregation-driven inequality across
neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Hardly had the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify zoning rules and land-use
regulation occurred when the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which mobility tracking with administrative records
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample;
this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

Only by analysts began combining mobility tracking with administrative records with cross-
site comparisons was the field forced to accept that claims about residential segregation
and the persistence of neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and
started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which
wealth accumulation gaps could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
zoning rules and land-use regulation often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which
changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, persistent
neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about residential
segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Even if the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the
result is a framework in which wealth accumulation gaps is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that comparability across cases is important mainly because:
   A. it prevents mobility constraints across space from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control path dependence from historical redlining
   B. Because mobility constraints across space appears, the mechanism must be unique, so path dependence from historical redlining can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if quasi-experimental policy evaluation produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   D. Because path dependence from historical redlining co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

2. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows.
   A. wealth accumulation gaps specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. path dependence from historical redlining alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. quasi-experimental policy evaluation as a device rather than as an analytic approach

4. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates zoning rules and land-use regulation.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in large U.S. metropolitan areas and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on spatial autocorrelation analysis simple.

5. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats European migrant neighborhoods as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.
   B. The passage suggests that mobility constraints across space is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving audit studies in housing markets.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when informational asymmetries in housing search can mimic mobility constraints across space.

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the passage juxtapose two accounts of the phenomenon?
   A. The author suggests that the key synonym 'spatial stratification in cities' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where quasi-experimental policy evaluation constrains path dependence from historical redlining
   C. The author argues that quasi-experimental policy evaluation should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The passage treats mobility constraints across space as a confounder and path dependence from historical redlining as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **persistent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because zoning rules and land-use regulation dominates all evidence
   B. lasting
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like mobility tracking with administrative records are needed
   D. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail

8. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | spatial autocorrelation analysis | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | mobility constraints across space | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | zoning rules and land-use regulation | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces longitudinal panel data with intuition.
   B. Samples only part of the system
   C. It makes informational asymmetries in housing search irrelevant.
   D. Can be contaminated by background variability

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats spatial autocorrelation analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss wealth accumulation gaps or path dependence from historical redlining. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting spatial autocorrelation analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that wealth accumulation gaps is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how path dependence from historical redlining can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from post-industrial cities. Finally, it maintains that tests combining spatial autocorrelation analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   D. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because wealth accumulation gaps uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that path dependence from historical redlining is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using spatial autocorrelation analysis are unnecessary.

10. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. audit studies in housing markets
   B. wealth accumulation gaps
   C. the length of the Nile in miles
   D. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality
