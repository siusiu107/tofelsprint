Passage 0302: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 735)

In the last decade, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated spurious molecular
detections as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy. Even
though chromatic transit analysis can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage
argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—spurious molecular
detections—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat spurious molecular detections as an endpoint looks decisive,
the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts becomes more predictive under replication. In this sense, unocculted spot/facula
bias in transit data is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on starspot temperature contrasts, the key
question becomes whether many early studies framed stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized spurious
molecular detections as a signature in one account, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ in another. this shift mattered for
how evidence from multi-epoch JWST targets was generalized because local conditions can
change which processes generate spurious molecular detections, which is why replication
matters.

Rarely, unless analysts began combining chromatic transit analysis with cross-site
comparisons, does one see why claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which spurious molecular detections could be explained in more
than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like starspot temperature contrasts
often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an
empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable. In this sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Rarely, unless the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify starspot temperature
contrasts, does one see why the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. [A] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as
mechanism. by comparing cases in which chromatic transit analysis constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author treats this as
a clue rather than as a nuisance. Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does
not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.
[C] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested. [D] The passage
emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating them as afterthoughts.

To be sure, the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, yet the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how starspot
temperature contrasts can shift baselines, altering whether spurious molecular detections is
even comparable across cases, something that means that a good fit is not the same as a good
explanation. If starspot temperature contrasts is changed while the nominal driver remains
constant, a different prediction follows: one should expect different outcomes when
conditions are perturbed. In this sense, photospheric contamination of transmission spectra
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Even though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong,
the result is a framework in which spurious molecular detections is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

   C. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy
   D. the author’s favorite color

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | simultaneous photometric monitoring | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering | Can be degenerate with another effect |

   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Can be degenerate with another effect
   B. Can introduce systematic bias
   C. It replaces simultaneous photometric monitoring with intuition.
   D. It makes facula coverage fractions irrelevant.

6. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates facula coverage fractions.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on simultaneous photometric monitoring simple.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in multi-epoch JWST targets and everywhere else.

7. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the author’s main reason for mentioning an alternative model?
   A. The passage implies that active K-dwarf host stars is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author argues that spot–facular forward modeling should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'stellar heterogeneity effects on retrieval' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where spot–facular forward modeling constrains facula coverage fractions

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Because apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering appears, the mechanism must be unique, so instrument drift across visits can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   C. it prevents apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control instrument drift across visits
   D. Because instrument drift across visits co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like facula coverage fractions make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting Gaussian-process detrending as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats Gaussian-process detrending as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rotation-modulated light curves or facula coverage fractions. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because rotation-modulated light curves uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that facula coverage fractions is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using Gaussian-process detrending are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that rotation-modulated light curves is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how facula coverage fractions can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from M-dwarf systems with repeated transits. Finally, it maintains that tests combining Gaussian-process detrending with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.

   A. complete and final, so no further checks like spot–facular forward modeling are needed
   B. reasonable
   C. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because starspot temperature contrasts dominates all evidence
