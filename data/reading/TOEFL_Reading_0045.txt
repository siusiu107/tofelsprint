Passage 0045: CRISPR-Cas as Bacterial Immune Memory in a Phage Arms Race (Microbiology)
=======================================================================================
(Word count: 615)

Bacteria and the viruses that infect them—bacteriophages—are locked in an evolutionary arms
race that is both ancient and surprisingly inventive. A phage injects genetic material into
a bacterial cell and commandeers the cell’s machinery to replicate. If the bacterium has no
defense, infection can be fatal. Yet bacteria are not passive victims. They cut viral DNA
with restriction enzymes, they block viral entry, and, in many lineages, they maintain a
memory of past attacks using a system known as CRISPR‑Cas.

CRISPR, short for “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,” is a genomic
archive composed of repeated sequences separated by spacers. The spacers are fragments of
DNA captured from prior phage invaders. When a bacterium survives an infection, it can
integrate a new spacer into its CRISPR array, adding the phage’s sequence to its record.
Later, the bacterium transcribes the array into RNA molecules that guide Cas proteins to
matching viral DNA. If a phage with the same sequence attacks again, the Cas nuclease can
cut the phage genome, neutralizing the infection. [A] The logic resembles vaccination,
though the mechanism is molecular: survival leaves a sequence-based trace that improves
future resistance.

Not all CRISPR systems work identically. Some use a single effector protein, while others
assemble multi-protein complexes. Some target DNA, others target RNA. These differences
matter because phages adapt. A phage can mutate the target sequence to escape recognition,
and because phage replication is rapid, escape variants can spread quickly. Bacteria respond
by acquiring additional spacers or by using CRISPR types that tolerate certain mismatches.
Meanwhile, phages have evolved countermeasures known as anti‑CRISPR proteins, which can
inhibit Cas activity, preventing cleavage. [B] In this escalating contest, “memory” is not
permanent; it is continually challenged by viral innovation.

CRISPR memory is also costly. Maintaining and expressing Cas proteins consumes resources,
and there is a risk of autoimmunity if the system targets the bacterium’s own DNA. For that
reason, some bacteria regulate CRISPR activity, turning it on when phage threat is high and
down when it is not. Moreover, because bacteria often exchange genes through horizontal
transfer, CRISPR can influence which genes are accepted. A bacterium with aggressive CRISPR
targeting may block plasmids that carry beneficial traits such as antibiotic resistance,
trading immediate viral defense for reduced adaptability in other arenas.

Ecologically, CRISPR shapes microbial communities. In environments with diverse phage
populations, bacterial lineages can diversify into “immunity types” defined by their spacer
sets. Phages, in turn, specialize on hosts they can infect, and the resulting coevolution
can maintain diversity rather than eliminating it. In laboratory microcosms, researchers
observe cycles: a bacterial genotype rises, phages evolve to infect it, the genotype
declines, and a new resistant genotype takes its place. [C] These cycles show that immunity
can structure populations the way predators structure prey, not by total extermination, but
by shifting which variants are competitive at a given time.

The CRISPR‑Cas system became famous because scientists adapted it as a tool for genome
editing. Yet its biological origin matters for how the tool behaves. The same requirement
for sequence matching that gives bacteria specificity can produce off-target cutting in
complex genomes, and the same arms-race logic suggests why engineered systems can be
undermined by mutations. Understanding CRISPR as a natural immune strategy thus clarifies
both its power and its limitations.

In short, CRISPR is a record of conflict written into DNA. [D] Each spacer is a fossil of an
encounter, and each Cas protein is a weapon tuned by selection. What appears, in the
laboratory, as a programmable editing platform is, in the microbial world, a living archive
of who attacked whom—and who survived long enough to remember.


Questions

2. [Factual] According to the passage, how does CRISPR-Cas provide resistance to a returning phage?
   A. RNA guides Cas proteins to matching viral sequences so the phage genome can be cut
   B. Bacteria produce antibodies that neutralize phages outside the cell
   C. Phages are prevented from mutating by CRISPR arrays
   D. CRISPR increases bacterial size so phages cannot attach

   Sentence to insert: The defense, in other words, is keyed to sequence identity rather than to a general alarm signal.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why anti‑CRISPR proteins would be favored in phages?

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author describe laboratory cycles of bacterial and phage genotypes?
   A. To illustrate how coevolution can maintain diversity through shifting resistance and infectivity
   B. To argue that CRISPR eliminates phages completely
   C. To show that horizontal gene transfer is impossible
   D. To claim that phages never mutate

7. [Reference] In the passage, “this escalating contest” refers to:
   A. the back-and-forth adaptations between bacterial CRISPR defenses and phage countermeasures
   B. a competition between bacteria for sugar
   C. a debate about genome editing ethics
   D. the evolution of multicellular animals

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces the phage-bacteria conflict, explains CRISPR memory and mechanism, then discusses diversity of systems, viral countermeasures, costs, ecological effects, and the link to genome-editing tools
