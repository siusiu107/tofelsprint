Passage 0918: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 736)

Despite apparently clean spectra, the passage argues that researchers have treated rotation-
modulated light curves as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy. To be sure, Gaussian-process detrending can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, yet the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather
than rely on familiar narratives.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify limb-darkening model
mismatch, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather
than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which Gaussian-process detrending constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is why
the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Granted that a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. In this sense, unocculted spot/facula bias in
transit data is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only when analysts began combining Gaussian-process detrending with cross-site comparisons
did claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying on a single
figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. [A] That point is not rhetorical; it
controls which prediction follows. the goal was to break degeneracies in which rotation-
modulated light curves could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
limb-darkening model mismatch often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication
matters. [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid
overclaiming. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue
rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. [C] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. [D] The passage
returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on limb-darkening model mismatch, the
argument reframes the issue so that many early studies framed stellar contamination in
transit spectroscopy as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized
rotation-modulated light curves as a signature, later work asked whether the same signature
survives when protocols and baselines differ. this shift mattered for how evidence from
M-dwarf systems with repeated transits was generalized because, as the author notes, local
conditions can change which processes generate rotation-modulated light curves. In this
sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label.

While it is true that the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage
insists that uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how
limb-darkening model mismatch can shift baselines, altering whether rotation-modulated light
curves is even comparable across cases, a move that means that a good fit is not the same as
a good explanation. If limb-darkening model mismatch is changed while the nominal driver
remains constant holds, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation,
a different prediction follows: then the same observation—rotation-modulated light
curves—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas
popular summaries treat rotation-modulated light curves as an endpoint may be convenient,
the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts is scientifically revealing. In this sense, photospheric contamination of
transmission spectra is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
To be sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, yet the
result is a framework in which rotation-modulated light curves is interpreted through
explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy
   B. the price of coal in 1700
   C. apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering
   D. chromatic transit analysis

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on multi-epoch transit campaigns simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates facula coverage fractions.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in M-dwarf systems with repeated transits and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies one mechanism.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like limb-darkening model mismatch make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting multi-epoch transit campaigns as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats multi-epoch transit campaigns as a historical curiosity and does not discuss rotation-modulated light curves or limb-darkening model mismatch. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because rotation-modulated light curves uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that limb-darkening model mismatch is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using multi-epoch transit campaigns are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that rotation-modulated light curves is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how limb-darkening model mismatch can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from bright nearby planet hosts. Finally, it maintains that tests combining multi-epoch transit campaigns with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when instrument drift across visits can mimic spurious molecular detections.
   B. The author treats active K-dwarf host stars as a special case and argues that no broader inference about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy is possible.
   C. The passage suggests that spurious molecular detections is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving Gaussian-process detrending.

   B. Because starspot temperature contrasts co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. Since rotation-modulated light curves is observed in M-dwarf systems with repeated transits, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. it prevents rotation-modulated light curves from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control starspot temperature contrasts

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where simultaneous photometric monitoring constrains instrument drift across visits
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'photospheric contamination of transmission spectra' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
   C. The passage implies that M-dwarf systems with repeated transits is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
