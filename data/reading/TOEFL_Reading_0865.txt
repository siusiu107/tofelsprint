Passage 0865: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 647)

Despite local variability, the passage argues that researchers have treated reduced
photosynthetic efficiency as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves. To be sure, degree-heating-week metrics can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, yet the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. [A] The discussion treats exceptions as informative,
not as errors to be discarded. If one wishes to move from description to explanation holds,
then the same observation—reduced photosynthetic efficiency—must be paired with tests that
change the conditions under which it appears. [B] The author notes that generalization
requires more than a single well-chosen case. Whereas popular summaries treat reduced
photosynthetic efficiency as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary
conditions to be stated. [C] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. [D] The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols
are comparable. In this sense, thermal bleaching events is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from description to explanation
to fail, then the same observation—reduced photosynthetic efficiency—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
reduced photosynthetic efficiency as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it
as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary
conditions to be stated.

In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike Red Sea reefs. the same summary statistic
could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed in part because disease
outbreaks shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. The issue is not
treating reduced photosynthetic efficiency as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the
author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense, loss of symbiotic
zooxanthellae under heat stress is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

It is the apparent regularity of reduced photosynthetic efficiency, rather than a single
headline feature, that drives the first interpretation: reduced photosynthetic efficiency is
treated as a direct readout of mechanism. If reduced photosynthetic efficiency is uniquely
produced by one causal pathway is granted, then observations from Red Sea reefs would be
transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. the literature is full of such
claims, not because the caveat that disease outbreaks might reproduce the same pattern, but
because the assumptions differ. In this sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is
precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary. Admittedly, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive
answer is strong; nevertheless, the result is a framework in which reduced photosynthetic
efficiency is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The passage treats shifts in carbonate accretion as a confounder and local adaptation as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where reef-scale temperature loggers constrains local adaptation
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'reef-scale bleaching episodes' refers to a different field altogether, not to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves.
   D. The passage implies that the Great Barrier Reef is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on photophysiology measurements simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates compound stressors such as acidification and pollution.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Great Barrier Reef and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because reduced photosynthetic efficiency uniquely identifies one mechanism.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because changes in reef fish assemblages uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that compound stressors such as acidification and pollution is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using reef-scale temperature loggers are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats reef-scale temperature loggers as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in reef fish assemblages or compound stressors such as acidification and pollution. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that changes in reef fish assemblages is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how compound stressors such as acidification and pollution can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Great Barrier Reef. Finally, it maintains that tests combining reef-scale temperature loggers with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   D. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like compound stressors such as acidification and pollution make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting reef-scale temperature loggers as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: If one wishes to move from description to explanation holds, then the same observation—reduced photosynthetic efficiency—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. changes in reef fish assemblages specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. satellite thermal stress maps as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. compound stressors such as acidification and pollution alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

   A. Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves
   B. degree-heating-week metrics
   C. reduced photosynthetic efficiency
   D. a list of Olympic medal counts

6. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

7. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize boundary conditions?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once mortality and phase shifts is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. Because local adaptation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. it prevents mortality and phase shifts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control local adaptation
   D. Because mortality and phase shifts appears, the mechanism must be unique, so local adaptation can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
