Passage 0609: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 659)

In large-scale platform studies, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated
disparate exposure to pollution as the decisive sign of residential segregation and the
persistence of neighborhood inequality. Granted that spatial autocorrelation analysis can
make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is
conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about
data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Rarely, unless analysts began combining spatial autocorrelation analysis with cross-site
comparisons, does one see why claims about residential segregation and the persistence of
neighborhood inequality stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on
falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which disparate exposure to
pollution could be explained in more than one way because confounders like credit market
discrimination often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, spatial stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on credit market discrimination, the
argument reframes the issue so that many early studies framed residential segregation and
the persistence of neighborhood inequality as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those
studies emphasized disparate exposure to pollution as a signature, later work asked whether
the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ. this shift mattered for how
evidence from large U.S. metropolitan areas was generalized because, as the author notes,
local conditions can change which processes generate disparate exposure to pollution.

Although the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how credit market
discrimination can shift baselines, altering whether disparate exposure to pollution is even
comparable across cases, something that means that a good fit is not the same as a good
explanation. Should credit market discrimination is changed while the nominal driver remains
constant be true, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In
this sense, segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify credit market discrimination
did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] The discussion treats exceptions as
informative, not as errors to be discarded. by comparing cases in which spatial
autocorrelation analysis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions
survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over
isolated exemplars. [B] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. Despite the fact that a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. [C] This is presented not as a loophole, but
as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. [D] This detail becomes important later, when
assumptions are tested. In this sense, persistent neighborhood-level disparities is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces
analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without
implying that any story is arbitrary. Even though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a
definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which disparate exposure to
pollution is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that boundary conditions is important mainly because:
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once mobility constraints across space is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if spatial autocorrelation analysis produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. it prevents mobility constraints across space from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control informational asymmetries in housing search
   D. Because mobility constraints across space appears, the mechanism must be unique, so informational asymmetries in housing search can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

2. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

3. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [C] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. wealth accumulation gaps specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. credit market discrimination alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. mobility tracking with administrative records as a device rather than as an analytic approach

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. mobility constraints across space
   B. longitudinal panel data
   C. the price of coal in 1700
   D. Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates credit market discrimination.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because school-quality gradients uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in European migrant neighborhoods and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on mobility tracking with administrative records simple.

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like zoning rules and land-use regulation make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting audit studies in housing markets as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because disparate exposure to pollution uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that zoning rules and land-use regulation is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using audit studies in housing markets are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats audit studies in housing markets as a historical curiosity and does not discuss disparate exposure to pollution or zoning rules and land-use regulation. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that disparate exposure to pollution is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how zoning rules and land-use regulation can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from European migrant neighborhoods. Finally, it maintains that tests combining audit studies in housing markets with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | audit studies in housing markets | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | disparate exposure to pollution | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | path dependence from historical redlining | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Can vary across epochs
   B. It makes zoning rules and land-use regulation irrelevant.
   C. It replaces mobility tracking with administrative records with intuition.
   D. Can introduce systematic bias

8. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that wealth accumulation gaps is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when zoning rules and land-use regulation can mimic wealth accumulation gaps.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using audit studies in housing markets.
   D. The author treats large U.S. metropolitan areas as a special case and argues that no broader inference about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality is possible.

9. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **coherent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: [A] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because path dependence from historical redlining dominates all evidence
   B. irrelevant to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like quasi-experimental policy evaluation are needed
   D. well organized

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The author argues that quasi-experimental policy evaluation should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The passage treats wealth accumulation gaps as a confounder and zoning rules and land-use regulation as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where quasi-experimental policy evaluation constrains zoning rules and land-use regulation
   D. The passage implies that rapidly growing Sun Belt regions is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
