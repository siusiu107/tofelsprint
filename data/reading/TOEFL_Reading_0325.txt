Passage 0325: Residential Segregation and the Persistence of Neighborhood Inequality (Sociology)
================================================================================================
(Word count: 751)

Against that intuitive story, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated mobility constraints across space as the decisive sign of
residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality. Admittedly, audit
studies in housing markets can make the pattern look unusually sharp; nevertheless, the
passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than
rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, researchers found that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike rapidly growing Sun Belt regions. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because path
dependence from historical redlining shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. Not treating mobility constraints across space as a self-sufficient conclusion, but
the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense, spatial
stratification in cities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same
observation—mobility constraints across space—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat mobility constraints
across space as an endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically revealing.

The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as
the lesson of residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move
from description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—mobility constraints
across space—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat mobility constraints across space as an endpoint may be
convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is scientifically revealing. In this sense, segregation-driven
inequality across neighborhoods is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Only when the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify path dependence from
historical redlining did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. [A] The author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-chosen
case. by comparing cases in which audit studies in housing markets constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why
the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The passage
emphasizes boundary conditions instead of treating them as afterthoughts. Although a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. [C] The argument hinges on what would change under
an alternative explanation. [D] The author uses the detour to show why a different metric
would lead to a different conclusion.

The decisive factor is the apparent regularity of mobility constraints across space; once
that is stated, drives the first interpretation: mobility constraints across space is
treated as a direct readout of mechanism. Should mobility constraints across space is
uniquely produced by one causal pathway be true, then observations from rapidly growing Sun
Belt regions would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. The issue
is not the caveat that path dependence from historical redlining might reproduce the same
pattern; it is that the literature is full of such claims. In this sense, persistent
neighborhood-level disparities is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be
conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is
precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that
any story is arbitrary. Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is
strong, the result is a framework in which mobility constraints across space is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats spatial autocorrelation analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss mobility constraints across space or path dependence from historical redlining. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage examines residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality and argues that mobility constraints across space is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how path dependence from historical redlining can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from rapidly growing Sun Belt regions. Finally, it maintains that tests combining spatial autocorrelation analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about spatial stratification in cities robust.
   C. The passage argues that persistent neighborhood-level disparities cannot be studied empirically because confounders like path dependence from historical redlining make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting spatial autocorrelation analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that segregation-driven inequality across neighborhoods is settled because mobility constraints across space uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that path dependence from historical redlining is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using spatial autocorrelation analysis are unnecessary.

2. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. a recipe for bread fermentation
   B. spatial autocorrelation analysis

   D. The passage suggests that disparate exposure to pollution is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: If one wishes to move from description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—mobility constraints across space—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which is precisely why clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because disparate exposure to pollution uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on spatial autocorrelation analysis simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in large U.S. metropolitan areas and everywhere else.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates path dependence from historical redlining.

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The passage implies that rapidly growing Sun Belt regions is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal panel data constrains zoning rules and land-use regulation
   C. The author argues that longitudinal panel data should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'spatial stratification in cities' refers to a different field altogether, not to residential segregation and the persistence of neighborhood inequality.

10. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. Because zoning rules and land-use regulation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. The passage implies that audit studies in housing markets directly measures causes, meaning confounding from zoning rules and land-use regulation is impossible.
   C. it prevents wealth accumulation gaps from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control zoning rules and land-use regulation
   D. Since wealth accumulation gaps is observed in large U.S. metropolitan areas, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
