Passage 0589: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 789)

When memory is tested repeatedly, one sees why researchers have treated increased liking for
chosen options as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. Admittedly, implicit association tests can make the pattern look unusually
sharp; nevertheless, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to
articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. In replication
attempts, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the apparent consensus
fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike workplace decision
settings. [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. The
passage argues that the same summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying
mechanisms differed because cultural norms about consistency shifted the baseline in
different directions across sites. [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a
disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. Rather than treating increased liking for chosen
options as a self-sufficient conclusion, the passage emphasizes that the author therefore
separates detection from interpretation. [C] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts
what is measured with what is inferred. [D] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. In
this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather
than as a mere label. It is the apparent regularity of increased liking for chosen options,
rather than a single headline feature, that drives the first interpretation: increased
liking for chosen options is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. Were increased liking
for chosen options is uniquely produced by one causal pathway to fail, then observations
from workplace decision settings would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely
technical. the literature is full of such claims, not because the caveat that cultural norms
about consistency might reproduce the same pattern, but because the assumptions differ. Not
until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about consistency
was it clear that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which implicit association tests constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is
why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Granted that a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. Never before the field adopted tests that
manipulate or stratify cultural norms about consistency was it defensible to argue that the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which implicit association tests constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is why the passage emphasizes
comparative design over isolated exemplars. Despite the fact that a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. If anything is responsible,
it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing
models would also predict. Should one wishes to move from description to explanation be
true, then the same observation—increased liking for chosen options—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
increased liking for chosen options as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as
a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. The point
is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the lesson of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation
is granted, then the same observation—increased liking for chosen options—must be paired
with tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries
treat increased liking for chosen options as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts. In this sense, self-
justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the
evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats workplace decision settings as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using longitudinal attitude surveys.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when cultural norms about consistency can mimic selective memory for supporting evidence.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away cultural norms about consistency, since variability is merely a measurement error.

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in workplace decision settings and everywhere else.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on longitudinal attitude surveys simple.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies one mechanism.

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where meta-analytic synthesis constrains public versus private commitment
   B. The passage implies that political opinion panels is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author argues that meta-analytic synthesis should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The passage treats selective memory for supporting evidence as a confounder and public versus private commitment as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.

4. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | longitudinal attitude surveys | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | devaluation of rejected alternatives | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | self-concept threat | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Shifts the baseline
   B. It makes public versus private commitment irrelevant.
   C. It replaces implicit association tests with intuition.
   D. It proves selective memory for supporting evidence is unique.

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. devaluation of rejected alternatives specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   B. public versus private commitment alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. implicit association tests as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

6. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This point matters because the simplest interpretation often survives only by silently restricting the range of cases under discussion.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]

7. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. shifted confidence judgments
   B. longitudinal attitude surveys
   C. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   D. the author’s favorite color

8. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that public versus private commitment is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using implicit association tests are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like public versus private commitment make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting implicit association tests as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how public versus private commitment can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-national survey samples. Finally, it maintains that tests combining implicit association tests with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats implicit association tests as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or public versus private commitment. It ends without any methodological implication.

9. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. Because devaluation of rejected alternatives appears, the mechanism must be unique, so cultural norms about consistency can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   B. it prevents devaluation of rejected alternatives from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once devaluation of rejected alternatives is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. Since devaluation of rejected alternatives is observed in cross-national survey samples, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Were increased liking for chosen options is uniquely produced by one causal pathway to fail, then observations from workplace decision settings would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because cultural norms about consistency dominates all evidence
   B. important
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like meta-analytic synthesis are needed
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
