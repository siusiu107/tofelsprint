Passage 0760: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 749)

Under multi-epoch monitoring, the passage argues that researchers have treated apparent
slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in
transit spectroscopy. Granted that multi-epoch transit campaigns can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for, which is precisely why forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike bright nearby planet hosts. the same
summary statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed in part
because limb-darkening model mismatch shifted the baseline in different directions across
sites. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation—not treating apparent
slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense,
unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation is granted, then the same observation—apparent slopes mimicking
Rayleigh scattering—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as an
endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify limb-darkening model mismatch
did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became empirically
productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious,
yet the author frames it as conditional. by comparing cases in which multi-epoch transit
campaigns constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of
sample, a move that is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated
exemplars. [B] The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols are
comparable. To be sure, a single case can be dramatic, yet the author does not deny the
value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. [C] The
author uses the detour to show why a different metric would lead to a different conclusion.
[D] The author treats this as a clue rather than as a nuisance. In this sense, activity-
driven spectral distortion is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify limb-darkening model mismatch
did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which multi-epoch transit campaigns constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative.

Not until analysts began combining multi-epoch transit campaigns with cross-site comparisons
was it clear that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying
on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break
degeneracies in which apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering could be explained in
more than one way in part because confounders like limb-darkening model mismatch often co-
vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical
issue rather than a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable. In this sense, photospheric contamination of transmission spectra
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which
clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is
arbitrary. Even if the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the
result is a framework in which apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering is interpreted
through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates instrument drift across visits.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in M-dwarf systems with repeated transits and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because rotation-modulated light curves uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on simultaneous photometric monitoring simple.

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **robust** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Even if the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because instrument drift across visits dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like simultaneous photometric monitoring are needed
   C. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail
   D. strong and reliable

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats chromatic transit analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering or instrument drift across visits. It ends without any methodological implication.
   B. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that instrument drift across visits is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using chromatic transit analysis are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like instrument drift across visits make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting chromatic transit analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how instrument drift across visits can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from bright nearby planet hosts. Finally, it maintains that tests combining chromatic transit analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage presents as the lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. spurious molecular detections specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. instrument drift across visits alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. multi-epoch transit campaigns as a device rather than as an analytic approach

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where multi-epoch transit campaigns constrains starspot temperature contrasts
   B. The passage treats spurious molecular detections as a confounder and starspot temperature contrasts as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The passage implies that active K-dwarf host stars is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The author argues that multi-epoch transit campaigns should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | spot–facular forward modeling | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | starspot temperature contrasts | Changes the apparent slope |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.

   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving chromatic transit analysis.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facula coverage fractions can mimic spurious molecular detections.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away facula coverage fractions, since variability is merely a measurement error.

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: That shift in framing changed which questions were even worth asking, since 'detection' and 'interpretation' were no longer treated as the same task.

   B. spot–facular forward modeling
   C. time-variable spectral baselines
   D. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy

10. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once spurious molecular detections is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. it prevents spurious molecular detections from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control instrument drift across visits
   C. Because instrument drift across visits co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   D. Since spurious molecular detections is observed in active K-dwarf host stars, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
