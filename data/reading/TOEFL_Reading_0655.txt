Passage 0655: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 789)

In hazard assessments, researchers found that researchers have treated low-frequency tremor
bursts as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip. Despite
the fact that continuous GPS geodesy can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage
argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
which forces analysts to admit that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather
than rely on familiar narratives. Never before analysts began combining continuous GPS
geodesy with cross-site comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about subduction-
zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started
relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to break degeneracies in which low-
frequency tremor bursts could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
fluid overpressure in faults often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication
matters. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label. Using continuous GPS geodesy under stable conditions,
one frequently cited case from the Cascadia subduction zone appeared to support the direct-
readout view. [A] The author suggests that the same evidence can support multiple stories
when priors differ. Though the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in fluid overpressure in faults altered the baseline
enough to mute or mimic low-frequency tremor bursts. [B] That point is not rhetorical; it
controls which prediction follows. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, something
that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. [C] The argument hinges on what would change under an alternative explanation.
[D] The discussion treats exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. The
decisive factor is the apparent regularity of low-frequency tremor bursts; once that is
stated, drives the first interpretation: low-frequency tremor bursts is treated as a direct
readout of mechanism. Should low-frequency tremor bursts is uniquely produced by one causal
pathway be true, then observations from the Cascadia subduction zone would be transferable,
and disagreement would be largely technical. the literature is full of such claims, not
because the caveat that fluid overpressure in faults might reproduce the same pattern, but
because the assumptions differ. Rarely, unless analysts began combining continuous GPS
geodesy with cross-site comparisons, does one see why claims about subduction-zone
megathrust earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying
on falsifiable predictions. The passage argues that the goal was to break degeneracies in
which low-frequency tremor bursts could be explained in more than one way because
confounders like fluid overpressure in faults often co-vary with the driver. as the author
notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice,
something that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. In this sense, episodic
tremor and slip is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. It
is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of subduction-zone
megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is constrained by what competing models
would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same
observation—low-frequency tremor bursts—must be paired with tests that change the conditions
under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat
low-frequency tremor bursts as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. Though the
first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that uniqueness is
precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how fluid overpressure in faults
can shift baselines, altering whether low-frequency tremor bursts is even comparable across
cases, something that means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation. Provided
that fluid overpressure in faults is changed while the nominal driver remains constant, one
should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In this sense, slow-slip
events on plate interfaces is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label. In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is
often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims
about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The passage treats low-frequency tremor bursts as a confounder and fluid overpressure in faults as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The discussion suggests that fluid overpressure in faults is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where numerical rupture simulations constrains fluid overpressure in faults
   D. The author argues that numerical rupture simulations should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | inversion of seismic waveforms | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | tsunami-generating seafloor uplift | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | heterogeneous frictional properties | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Samples only part of the system
   B. It makes heterogeneous frictional properties irrelevant.
   C. Can mimic the target feature
   D. It proves transient surface deformation is unique.

3. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that foreshock clustering is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how stress transfer after large events can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Cascadia subduction zone. Finally, it maintains that tests combining inversion of seismic waveforms with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   B. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like stress transfer after large events make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting inversion of seismic waveforms as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because foreshock clustering uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that stress transfer after large events is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using inversion of seismic waveforms are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats inversion of seismic waveforms as a historical curiosity and does not discuss foreshock clustering or stress transfer after large events. It ends without any methodological implication.

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Never before analysts began combining continuous GPS geodesy with cross-site comparisons was it defensible to argue that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.

   B. transient surface deformation specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. heterogeneous frictional properties alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on seafloor pressure sensors simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates heterogeneous frictional properties.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Japan Trench region and everywhere else.
   D. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies one mechanism.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. it prevents low-frequency tremor bursts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control fluid overpressure in faults
   B. The passage implies that paleoseismic trenching directly measures causes, meaning confounding from fluid overpressure in faults is impossible.
   C. Since low-frequency tremor bursts is observed in the Cascadia subduction zone, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once low-frequency tremor bursts is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
