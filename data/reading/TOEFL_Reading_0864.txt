Passage 0864: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 718)

In the last decade, the analysis suggests researchers have treated time-variable spectral
baselines as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy. Though
chromatic transit analysis can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues
that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the
resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for,
which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar
narratives.

In replication attempts, the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were
applied in settings unlike M-dwarf systems with repeated transits. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because, as the
author notes, limb-darkening model mismatch shifted the baseline in different directions
across sites. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation—not treating
time-variable spectral baselines as a self-sufficient conclusion. In this sense, unocculted
spot/facula bias in transit data is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Only by analysts began combining chromatic transit analysis with cross-site comparisons was
the field forced to accept that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which time-variable spectral baselines could be explained in
more than one way because, as the author notes, confounders like limb-darkening model
mismatch often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors
became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit
that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify limb-darkening model mismatch
did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing
cases in which chromatic transit analysis constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify limb-darkening model mismatch
did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. [A] The passage
frames uncertainty as an ingredient of inference rather than as an embarrassment. by
comparing cases in which chromatic transit analysis constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The author suggests that the same
evidence can support multiple stories when priors differ. Admittedly, a single case can be
dramatic; nevertheless, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. [C] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which
prediction follows. [D] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive
test.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation
is granted, then the same observation—time-variable spectral baselines—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
time-variable spectral baselines as an endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as
a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret
without assumptions. In this sense, photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Granted that
the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a
framework in which time-variable spectral baselines is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The passage treats time-variable spectral baselines as a confounder and facula coverage fractions as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.
   C. The discussion suggests that facula coverage fractions is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where spot–facular forward modeling constrains facula coverage fractions

2. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats bright nearby planet hosts as a special case and argues that no broader inference about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy is possible.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving simultaneous photometric monitoring.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facula coverage fractions can mimic time-variable spectral baselines.
   D. The passage suggests that time-variable spectral baselines is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

3. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in multi-epoch JWST targets and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates starspot temperature contrasts.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on spot–facular forward modeling simple.

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that spurious molecular detections is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how instrument drift across visits can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from active K-dwarf host stars. Finally, it maintains that tests combining Gaussian-process detrending with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   B. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because spurious molecular detections uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that instrument drift across visits is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using Gaussian-process detrending are unnecessary.
   C. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like instrument drift across visits make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting Gaussian-process detrending as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats Gaussian-process detrending as a historical curiosity and does not discuss spurious molecular detections or instrument drift across visits. It ends without any methodological implication.

5. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. spot–facular forward modeling

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. limb-darkening model mismatch alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. rotation-modulated light curves specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. simultaneous photometric monitoring as a device rather than as an analytic approach

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

8. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **degenerate** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Only by analysts began combining chromatic transit analysis with cross-site comparisons was the field forced to accept that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
   A. not uniquely determined
   B. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like chromatic transit analysis are needed
   D. unavoidable and uncontrollable because instrument drift across visits dominates all evidence

9. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The passage implies that simultaneous photometric monitoring directly measures causes, meaning confounding from limb-darkening model mismatch is impossible.
   B. Since time-variable spectral baselines is observed in active K-dwarf host stars, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   C. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once time-variable spectral baselines is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   D. it prevents time-variable spectral baselines from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control limb-darkening model mismatch
