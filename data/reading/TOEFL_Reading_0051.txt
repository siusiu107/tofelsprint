Passage 0051: Obsidian Fingerprints and What Volcanic Glass Reveals About Ancient Exchange (Archaeology)
========================================================================================================
(Word count: 648)

Obsidian, the volcanic glass that forms when lava cools so quickly that crystals cannot
grow, fractures with a sharpness that once rivaled steel. For archaeologists, however, its
most valuable property is not its edge but its chemistry. Each volcanic flow inherits a
distinct trace-element “signature” from the magma and from the crust it melts through. Two
nodules may look identical in the hand, yet their ratios of elements such as zirconium,
rubidium, and strontium can differ enough to reveal where they were born.

This insight transformed the study of prehistoric exchange. Before geochemical sourcing, a
scatter of obsidian blades at a site could be taken as evidence of local toolmaking or of
general contact with “somewhere volcanic.” Once portable X‑ray fluorescence instruments
became common, researchers could measure element ratios on-site, often without damaging the
artifact. A blade from a coastal village might match a distant inland flow, while another
blade at the same village might match an island volcano. [A] The deposit becomes, in effect,
a ledger: each piece of glass records a different link in a network of movement.

Consider an inland valley with no volcanoes. If obsidian appears there in large quantities,
two simple stories compete. One is direct procurement: people traveled to the source,
quarried nodules, and returned. The other is down‑the‑line exchange: obsidian changed hands
repeatedly through intermediate communities, so that no single group traveled the full
distance. Chemistry alone cannot decide between these stories, but it can constrain them. If
valley obsidian comes from only one source, consistent with a regular trip to a familiar
quarry, direct procurement becomes plausible. If, instead, the valley contains glass from
many sources—some far, some near—then exchange networks look more likely, because a single
community would have to maintain many long-distance routes simultaneously.

Obsidian can also be used to estimate time, though with caution. In humid air, water slowly
diffuses into fresh obsidian, forming a hydration rim whose thickness increases with age.
Measuring that rim can provide a relative chronology: thicker rims usually indicate older
surfaces. Yet the rate depends on temperature and on the glass’s composition, meaning that a
rim measured on one volcano’s obsidian cannot be read with the same calendar conversion as a
rim on another volcano’s glass. [B] Hydration dating is therefore strongest when calibrated
locally—when archaeologists can compare rims to artifacts whose age is known from
independent evidence such as charcoal radiocarbon dates.

When sourcing and dating are combined, richer narratives become possible. A region might
show early reliance on a nearby source, followed by a later surge of distant obsidian,
suggesting either expanding travel ranges or new alliances. In some cases, shifts in
obsidian supply coincide with changes in settlement patterns. A small village may begin to
import large quantities of high-quality obsidian at the same time that it builds communal
structures, hinting that gatherings and ritual exchange intensified. In other cases, a once-
dominant source becomes rare, perhaps because an eruption altered access, a political
boundary hardened, or a competing material—such as chert—became preferred for certain tools.

Obsidian studies also reveal the limits of tidy models. The same source can appear in elite
burials and in ordinary houses, suggesting that access was not fully controlled.
Alternatively, a distant source might appear only in a few ornaments, not in everyday
blades, implying that the material traveled as a prestige good rather than as a staple. [C]
In either case, the glass is a proxy for social relationships: it shows not only where
people moved, but also how value moved.

Thus, a single shard can be both stone and story. [D] Its trace elements fingerprint a
volcano; its distribution sketches routes; and, when paired with careful context, it helps
reconstruct the choices by which communities connected across a landscape that, to them, was
as politically textured as it was physically rugged.

Questions
---------
1. [Inference] What can be inferred from a valley site that contains obsidian from many distant and nearby sources?
   A. Multiple exchange connections likely brought glass through several communities rather than a single direct quarry trip.
   B. Multiple exchange connections likely brought glass through several communities rather than a single direct quarry trip. That would make on-site the primary constraint.
   C. Multiple exchange connections likely brought glass through several communities rather than a single direct quarry trip. This outcome would hold even if procurement stays constant.
   D. Multiple on-site connections likely brought glass through several communities rather than a single direct quarry trip. This outcome would hold even if high-quality stays constant.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “proxy” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a toolmaking technique in sense
   B. a hydration rim measurement
   C. a volcanic eruption in sense
   D. a stand-in indicator used to infer something else


3. [Factual] According to the passage, why do different obsidian flows have distinct chemical signatures?
   A. They inherit different on-site ratios from their magma and the crust they interact with. That would make consider the primary constraint.
   B. They inherit different trace-element ratios from their magma and the crust they interact with. This outcome would hold even if ancient stays constant.

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author contrast direct procurement with down‑the‑line exchange?

   B. To show how different movement mechanisms can produce different sourcing patterns at the same site.

7. [Reference] In the passage, “that rim” refers to:
   A. the hydration layer formed as water diffuses into obsidian. That would make chemistry the primary constraint.
