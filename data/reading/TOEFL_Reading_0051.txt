Passage 0051: Obsidian Fingerprints and What Volcanic Glass Reveals About Ancient Exchange (Archaeology)
========================================================================================================
(Word count: 648)

Obsidian, the volcanic glass that forms when lava cools so quickly that crystals cannot
grow, fractures with a sharpness that once rivaled steel. For archaeologists, however, its
most valuable property is not its edge but its chemistry. Each volcanic flow inherits a
distinct trace-element “signature” from the magma and from the crust it melts through. Two
nodules may look identical in the hand, yet their ratios of elements such as zirconium,
rubidium, and strontium can differ enough to reveal where they were born.

This insight transformed the study of prehistoric exchange. Before geochemical sourcing, a
scatter of obsidian blades at a site could be taken as evidence of local toolmaking or of
general contact with “somewhere volcanic.” Once portable X‑ray fluorescence instruments
became common, researchers could measure element ratios on-site, often without damaging the
artifact. A blade from a coastal village might match a distant inland flow, while another
blade at the same village might match an island volcano. [A] The deposit becomes, in effect,
a ledger: each piece of glass records a different link in a network of movement.

Consider an inland valley with no volcanoes. If obsidian appears there in large quantities,
two simple stories compete. One is direct procurement: people traveled to the source,
quarried nodules, and returned. The other is down‑the‑line exchange: obsidian changed hands
repeatedly through intermediate communities, so that no single group traveled the full
distance. Chemistry alone cannot decide between these stories, but it can constrain them. If
valley obsidian comes from only one source, consistent with a regular trip to a familiar
quarry, direct procurement becomes plausible. If, instead, the valley contains glass from
many sources—some far, some near—then exchange networks look more likely, because a single
community would have to maintain many long-distance routes simultaneously.

Obsidian can also be used to estimate time, though with caution. In humid air, water slowly
diffuses into fresh obsidian, forming a hydration rim whose thickness increases with age.
Measuring that rim can provide a relative chronology: thicker rims usually indicate older
surfaces. Yet the rate depends on temperature and on the glass’s composition, meaning that a
rim measured on one volcano’s obsidian cannot be read with the same calendar conversion as a
rim on another volcano’s glass. [B] Hydration dating is therefore strongest when calibrated
locally—when archaeologists can compare rims to artifacts whose age is known from
independent evidence such as charcoal radiocarbon dates.

When sourcing and dating are combined, richer narratives become possible. A region might
show early reliance on a nearby source, followed by a later surge of distant obsidian,
suggesting either expanding travel ranges or new alliances. In some cases, shifts in
obsidian supply coincide with changes in settlement patterns. A small village may begin to
import large quantities of high-quality obsidian at the same time that it builds communal
structures, hinting that gatherings and ritual exchange intensified. In other cases, a once-
dominant source becomes rare, perhaps because an eruption altered access, a political
boundary hardened, or a competing material—such as chert—became preferred for certain tools.

Obsidian studies also reveal the limits of tidy models. The same source can appear in elite
burials and in ordinary houses, suggesting that access was not fully controlled.
Alternatively, a distant source might appear only in a few ornaments, not in everyday
blades, implying that the material traveled as a prestige good rather than as a staple. [C]
In either case, the glass is a proxy for social relationships: it shows not only where
people moved, but also how value moved.

Thus, a single shard can be both stone and story. [D] Its trace elements fingerprint a
volcano; its distribution sketches routes; and, when paired with careful context, it helps
reconstruct the choices by which communities connected across a landscape that, to them, was
as politically textured as it was physically rugged.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Before geochemical sourcing, a scatter of obsidian blades at a site could be taken as evidence of local toolmaking or of general contact with “somewhere volcanic.” Once portable X‑ray fluorescence instruments became common, researchers could measure element ratios on-site, often without damaging the artifact.
   A. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across exchange
   B. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to glass and source
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of exchange

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage surveys obsidian but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed source first, with glass serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats exchange as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   B. The passage explains obsidian by linking glass to source, and it shows why exchange changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   C. The passage presents source as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once glass is observed, competing explanations for obsidian collapse. It treats exchange as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   D. The passage concedes that glass is often incomplete and concludes that obsidian cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since exchange overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of source with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, especially regarding glass.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how obsidian should change if exchange is altered, instead of assuming that glass has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to source must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage implies that exchange mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes glass effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of source no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain obsidian, in the examples provided.
   C. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in exchange, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of glass is enough to validate source for obsidian.
   D. The passage treats glass primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over source are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about obsidian are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement, under the stated assumptions, especially regarding glass.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of exchange as a factor influencing glass
   B. discussion of obsidian as a factor influencing glass, as framed by the author.
   C. discussion of source as a factor influencing glass
   D. discussion of allometric scaling as a factor influencing glass

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Before geochemical sourcing, a scatter of obsidian blades at a site could be taken as evidence of local toolmaking or of general contact with “somewhere volcanic.” Once portable X‑ray fluorescence instruments became common, researchers could measure element ratios on-site, often without damaging the artifact.
   A. Before geochemical sourcing. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   D. Before geochemical sourcing. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because glass directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding obsidian.
   B. Because comparability prevents source from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold exchange constant while examining glass.
   C. Because once glass fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and exchange can be ignored without changing conclusions about obsidian.
   D. Because the presence of source guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in exchange are merely stylistic noise.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | glass | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | exchange | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   B. It proves source is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic
   C. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   D. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that obsidian should be read alongside exchange, because glass alone does not settle what source means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This insight transformed the study of prehistoric exchange.
   A. the preceding claim about how glass is interpreted in relation to source
   B. the preceding claim that glass is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis
   C. the preceding claim that obsidian functions as a direct measurement of source
   D. the preceding claim that exchange alone explains the outcome of obsidian

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of glass and source should be abandoned altogether, in the context of the passage.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of glass lead to different conclusions about obsidian.
   C. to show that the term obsidian belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   D. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses source, so debate over glass is unnecessary noise, especially regarding source.
