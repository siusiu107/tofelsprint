Passage 0744: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 726)

From a cognitive-control perspective, researchers found that researchers have treated
selective memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and
post-decision rationalization. While it is true that meta-analytic synthesis can make the
pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike workplace decision settings. [A] The passage
signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. the same summary statistic could
be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed in part because measurement
reactivity shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. [B] This is presented
not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming. The issue is not treating
selective memory for supporting evidence as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the
author therefore separates detection from interpretation. [C] The author treats this as a
clue rather than as a nuisance. [D] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders
enter the pipeline. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity was it
clear that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which meta-analytic synthesis constrains alternatives, researchers could
ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps explain why is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still,
the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative.

Rarely, unless analysts began combining meta-analytic synthesis with cross-site comparisons,
does one see why claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which selective memory for supporting evidence could be explained in
more than one way in part because confounders like measurement reactivity often co-vary with
the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to
explanation, then the same observation—selective memory for supporting evidence—must be
paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with
confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an
endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental
or observational contrasts in another.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify measurement reactivity was
it defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which meta-analytic synthesis constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even if a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying
that any story is arbitrary. To be sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive
answer is strong, yet the result is a framework in which selective memory for supporting
evidence is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The author emphasizes that a clean-looking curve can still encode hidden choices, especially when preprocessing is treated as neutral.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

2. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. Because cultural norms about consistency co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency
   C. Because selective memory for supporting evidence appears, the mechanism must be unique, so cultural norms about consistency can be ignored as irrelevant noise.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once selective memory for supporting evidence is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal attitude surveys constrains measurement reactivity
   B. The passage implies that workplace decision settings is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'self-justification mechanisms' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   D. The author argues that longitudinal attitude surveys should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization
   B. implicit association tests
   C. selective memory for supporting evidence
   D. a recipe for bread fermentation

5. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid overclaiming.
   A. implicit association tests as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. increased liking for chosen options specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. measurement reactivity alone, treated as the sole cause

6. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **convergent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings unlike workplace decision settings.
   A. coming together
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like longitudinal attitude surveys are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because measurement reactivity dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like self-concept threat make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting meta-analytic synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats meta-analytic synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss devaluation of rejected alternatives or self-concept threat. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that self-concept threat is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using meta-analytic synthesis are unnecessary.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that devaluation of rejected alternatives is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how self-concept threat can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-national survey samples. Finally, it maintains that tests combining meta-analytic synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on implicit association tests simple.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates public versus private commitment.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.

9. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | meta-analytic synthesis | Can introduce systematic bias |
   | Signal | selective memory for supporting evidence | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | self-concept threat | Can mimic the target feature |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. Can mimic the target feature
   B. Can introduce systematic bias
   C. It makes measurement reactivity irrelevant.
   D. It proves shifted confidence judgments is unique.

10. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away public versus private commitment, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using behavioral priming designs.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic increased liking for chosen options.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving behavioral priming designs.
