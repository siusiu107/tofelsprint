Passage 0792: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 708)

In cross-site comparisons, researchers found that researchers have treated reduced
photosynthetic efficiency as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves. Though photophysiology measurements can make the pattern look unusually sharp,
the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on
familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were
applied in settings unlike the Coral Triangle. the same summary statistic could be
reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because compound stressors such as
acidification and pollution shifted the baseline in different directions across sites, which
is why replication matters. The issue is not treating reduced photosynthetic efficiency as a
self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from
interpretation. In this sense, thermal bleaching events is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of coral bleaching
triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what competing models would also
predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same
observation—reduced photosynthetic efficiency—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular
summaries treat reduced photosynthetic efficiency as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a
starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify compound stressors such as
acidification and pollution did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. [A] The discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as
mechanism. by comparing cases in which photophysiology measurements constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why
the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. [B] The discussion treats
exceptions as informative, not as errors to be discarded. To be sure, a single case can be
dramatic, yet the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. [C] The author notes that generalization requires more than
a single well-chosen case. [D] The author uses the example to separate detection from
interpretation. In this sense, loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Not the obvious explanation but methodological humility is what the passage presents as the
lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation,
a different prediction follows: then the same observation—reduced photosynthetic
efficiency—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat reduced photosynthetic efficiency as an endpoint is easy to
measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions.

In replication attempts, one sees why the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike the Coral Triangle. the same summary statistic
could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because, as the author notes,
compound stressors such as acidification and pollution shifted the baseline in different
directions across sites. the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, not
because treating reduced photosynthetic efficiency as a self-sufficient conclusion, but
because the assumptions differ. In this sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns
disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can
yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. the temptation to treat
a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; still, the result is a framework in which
reduced photosynthetic efficiency is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather
than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | photophysiology measurements | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | reduced photosynthetic efficiency | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | symbiont clade switching | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It proves recruitment failure is unique.
   B. Adds correlated noise
   C. Samples only part of the system
   D. May be sensitive to preprocessing choices

2. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Red Sea reefs and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because changes in reef fish assemblages uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates symbiont clade switching.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on photophysiology measurements simple.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when local adaptation can mimic reduced photosynthetic efficiency.
   B. The author treats the Great Barrier Reef as a special case and argues that no broader inference about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves is possible.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away local adaptation, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving photophysiology measurements.

4. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **convergent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating reduced photosynthetic efficiency as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ.
   A. coming together
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because symbiont clade switching dominates all evidence
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like symbiont genotyping are needed
   D. irrelevant to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves, serving only as background detail

5. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that changes in reef fish assemblages is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how compound stressors such as acidification and pollution can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Red Sea reefs. Finally, it maintains that tests combining satellite thermal stress maps with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   B. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like compound stressors such as acidification and pollution make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting satellite thermal stress maps as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because changes in reef fish assemblages uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that compound stressors such as acidification and pollution is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using satellite thermal stress maps are unnecessary.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats satellite thermal stress maps as a historical curiosity and does not discuss changes in reef fish assemblages or compound stressors such as acidification and pollution. It ends without any methodological implication.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize model assumptions?
   A. The passage implies that degree-heating-week metrics directly measures causes, meaning confounding from local adaptation is impossible.
   B. Because local adaptation co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   C. it prevents changes in reef fish assemblages from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control local adaptation
   D. Since changes in reef fish assemblages is observed in the Great Barrier Reef, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: That shift in framing changed which questions were even worth asking, since 'detection' and 'interpretation' were no longer treated as the same task.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: The issue is not treating reduced photosynthetic efficiency as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore separates detection from interpretation.
   A. symbiont genotyping as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. symbiont clade switching alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. shifts in carbonate accretion specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the passage juxtapose two accounts of the phenomenon?
   A. The passage treats shifts in carbonate accretion as a confounder and disease outbreaks as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   B. The author argues that satellite thermal stress maps should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where satellite thermal stress maps constrains disease outbreaks
   D. The discussion suggests that disease outbreaks is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

10. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves
   B. the price of coal in 1700
