Passage 0971: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 739)

When memory is tested repeatedly, the analysis suggests researchers have treated selective
memory for supporting evidence as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization. Granted that longitudinal attitude surveys can make the pattern
look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Using longitudinal attitude surveys under stable conditions, the key question becomes
whether one frequently cited case from consumer choice studies appeared to support the
direct-readout view. Although the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however,
reanalysis showed that small shifts in measurement reactivity altered the baseline enough to
mute or mimic selective memory for supporting evidence. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, something that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before
generalization is attempted. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

The point is not X but the apparent regularity of selective memory for supporting evidence;
in that framing, drives the first interpretation: selective memory for supporting evidence
is treated as a direct readout of mechanism. [A] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious,
yet the author frames it as conditional. If selective memory for supporting evidence is
uniquely produced by one causal pathway holds, then observations from consumer choice
studies would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. [B] The author
shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. the
literature is full of such claims—not the caveat that measurement reactivity might reproduce
the same pattern. [C] The author notes that generalization requires more than a single well-
chosen case. [D] The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols are
comparable.

Even if the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how measurement
reactivity can shift baselines, altering whether selective memory for supporting evidence is
even comparable across cases, which helps explain why means that a good fit is not the same
as a good explanation. Provided that measurement reactivity is changed while the nominal
driver remains constant, one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed.
In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from
description to explanation to fail, then the same observation—selective memory for
supporting evidence—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears. Whereas popular summaries treat selective memory for supporting evidence as an
endpoint may be convenient, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts is scientifically revealing.

Rarely has it been the case that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable
predictions, at least before analysts began combining longitudinal attitude surveys with
cross-site comparisons. the goal was to break degeneracies in which selective memory for
supporting evidence could be explained in more than one way because confounders like
measurement reactivity often co-vary with the driver, which is why replication matters. as
the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a
stylistic choice, which forces analysts to admit that changes whether two analyses are
actually comparable. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, one sees why the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record
can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Though the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which selective memory for supporting evidence is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats cross-national survey samples as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   B. The passage suggests that selective memory for supporting evidence is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when measurement reactivity can mimic selective memory for supporting evidence.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using implicit association tests.

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | choice-induced preference paradigms | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | shifted confidence judgments | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | self-concept threat | Changes the apparent slope |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Depends on modeling priors
   B. It makes public versus private commitment irrelevant.
   C. May be muted by other processes
   D. It proves increased liking for chosen options is unique.

3. [Rhetorical Purpose] What is the primary purpose of presenting more than one explanation?
   A. The author argues that choice-induced preference paradigms should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'attitude reconfiguration following commitment' refers to a different field altogether, not to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization.
   C. The passage treats shifted confidence judgments as a confounder and cultural norms about consistency as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where choice-induced preference paradigms constrains cultural norms about consistency

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining meta-analytic synthesis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   B. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting meta-analytic synthesis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats meta-analytic synthesis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using meta-analytic synthesis are unnecessary.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **attenuated** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.
   A. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   B. weakened
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because measurement reactivity dominates all evidence
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like meta-analytic synthesis are needed

6. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] At first glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. choice-induced preference paradigms as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. public versus private commitment alone, treated as the sole cause

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on longitudinal attitude surveys simple.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.

8. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize replication across contexts?
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if longitudinal attitude surveys produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once selective memory for supporting evidence is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   C. Since selective memory for supporting evidence is observed in cross-national survey samples, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. it prevents selective memory for supporting evidence from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control self-concept threat
