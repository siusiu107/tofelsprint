Passage 0700: Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy (Astronomy)
=======================================================================
(Word count: 649)

Despite apparently clean spectra, the analysis suggests researchers have treated apparent
slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as the decisive sign of stellar contamination in
transit spectroscopy. While it is true that Gaussian-process detrending can make the pattern
look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, an outcome that forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on facula coverage fractions, the argument
reframes the issue so that many early studies framed stellar contamination in transit
spectroscopy as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized apparent
slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as a signature, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ. this shift mattered for how evidence
from multi-epoch JWST targets was generalized largely because local conditions can change
which processes generate apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering. In this sense,
unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label.

Rarely, unless analysts began combining Gaussian-process detrending with cross-site
comparisons, does one see why claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy
stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering could be
explained in more than one way largely because confounders like facula coverage fractions
often co-vary with the driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an
empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, an outcome that changes whether two analyses
are actually comparable.

The point is not X but methodological humility; in that framing, the passage presents as the
lesson of stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation,
then the same observation—apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering—must be paired with
tests that change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat
apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes
more predictive under replication. In this sense, activity-driven spectral distortion is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Using Gaussian-process detrending under stable conditions, it is difficult to deny that one
frequently cited case from multi-epoch JWST targets appeared to support the direct-readout
view. [A] That point is not rhetorical; it controls which prediction follows. Granted that
the original fit looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small
shifts in facula coverage fractions altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic apparent
slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering. [B] This detail becomes important later, when
assumptions are tested. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, which forces analysts
to admit that illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is
attempted. [C] The author shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data
cannot rule out. [D] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence.
In this sense, photospheric contamination of transmission spectra is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often the evidence
that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about stellar
contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement
into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories
without implying that any story is arbitrary. Although the temptation to treat a tidy plot
as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which apparent slopes
mimicking Rayleigh scattering is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather
than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This detail becomes important later, when assumptions are tested.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. time-variable spectral baselines specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. facula coverage fractions alone, treated as the sole cause
   D. Gaussian-process detrending as a device rather than as an analytic approach

2. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | Gaussian-process detrending | Samples only part of the system |
   | Signal | time-variable spectral baselines | May be muted by other processes |
   | Confounder | limb-darkening model mismatch | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Method' is ________.
   A. It replaces multi-epoch transit campaigns with intuition.
   B. May be muted by other processes
   C. It proves rotation-modulated light curves is unique.
   D. Samples only part of the system

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. spot–facular forward modeling
   B. the length of the Nile in miles
   C. apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering
   D. Stellar Contamination in Transit Spectroscopy

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using simultaneous photometric monitoring.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away instrument drift across visits, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. The passage suggests that rotation-modulated light curves is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when instrument drift across visits can mimic rotation-modulated light curves.

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] By bringing up competing viewpoints, the author is trying to:
   A. The discussion suggests that limb-darkening model mismatch is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where Gaussian-process detrending constrains limb-darkening model mismatch
   C. The author argues that Gaussian-process detrending should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data' refers to a different field altogether, not to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy.

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. Because starspot temperature contrasts co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents spurious molecular detections from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control starspot temperature contrasts
   C. The passage implies that simultaneous photometric monitoring directly measures causes, meaning confounding from starspot temperature contrasts is impossible.
   D. Since spurious molecular detections is observed in multi-epoch JWST targets, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

7. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: This is why the author dwells on assumptions: without them, two teams can analyze the same record and still disagree honestly.

   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because spurious molecular detections uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in multi-epoch JWST targets and everywhere else.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates limb-darkening model mismatch.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on chromatic transit analysis simple.

9. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy and argues that time-variable spectral baselines is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how instrument drift across visits can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from bright nearby planet hosts. Finally, it maintains that tests combining spot–facular forward modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about unocculted spot/facula bias in transit data robust.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats spot–facular forward modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss time-variable spectral baselines or instrument drift across visits. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that photospheric contamination of transmission spectra cannot be studied empirically because confounders like instrument drift across visits make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting spot–facular forward modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage claims that activity-driven spectral distortion is settled because time-variable spectral baselines uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that instrument drift across visits is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using spot–facular forward modeling are unnecessary.

10. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Whereas those studies emphasized apparent slopes mimicking Rayleigh scattering as a signature, later work asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ.
   A. unavoidable and uncontrollable because limb-darkening model mismatch dominates all evidence
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like Gaussian-process detrending are needed
   C. important
   D. irrelevant to stellar contamination in transit spectroscopy, serving only as background detail
