Passage 0063: Potlatch as Public Exchange, Prestige, and Memory in Northwest Coast Societies (Anthropology)
===========================================================================================================
(Word count: 605)

Along the Northwest Coast of North America, where salmon runs could be abundant and cedar
forests provided durable materials, many Indigenous societies developed complex systems of
rank, ceremony, and exchange. Among the best-known ceremonial practices was the potlatch, a
gathering in which hosts distributed gifts—blankets, food, carved objects, later even
manufactured goods—to guests from other groups. To outsiders who equated value with
accumulation, the practice looked irrational: why would a leader give away wealth? Yet to
participants, potlatch was a logic of prestige, obligation, and memory.

A potlatch was not simply a feast with generous presents. It was often staged to mark events
such as marriages, births, deaths, or the inheritance of names and rights. When a host
distributed goods, the act publicly asserted the host’s status and validated claims to
titles or privileges. Guests, in turn, witnessed the claims and accepted gifts that created
reciprocal debts. A future potlatch would be expected, and the ability to repay—often with
interest, by giving more than one had received— became part of the competitive display. [A]
What looks like “waste” from one accounting system becomes investment in social recognition
in another.

Anthropologists debated how to interpret potlatch. Some emphasized ecology, noting that
coastal abundance allowed storage and redistribution; others emphasized politics, arguing
that potlatch stabilized hierarchy by binding followers and rivals into obligations. Later
scholars, wary of treating ceremony as mere economics, focused on meaning: the songs,
dances, and speeches that encoded history and law. A carved crest displayed at a potlatch
could be a legal argument, not only an aesthetic one. These interpretations do not cancel
one another, because potlatch operated simultaneously as material transfer, political
theater, and narrative performance.

The practice also became a flashpoint under colonial rule. In Canada, for example, officials
and missionaries criticized potlatch as disruptive and attempted to suppress it, viewing it
as an obstacle to assimilation. Legal bans were imposed, though enforcement varied and
communities found ways to adapt—holding smaller gatherings, disguising ceremonies as
holidays, or shifting what was given. The suppression itself altered the system: when public
distribution is constrained, the public validation of rank is constrained as well. [B]
Ironically, an attempt to eliminate the practice sometimes increased the stakes of the
occasions that could still be held, because they became rarer opportunities to reaffirm
identity.

In contemporary contexts, potlatch persists and evolves. Some communities have revived large
ceremonies, while others emphasize family-based events. Cash and store-bought goods can now
be part of giving, yet the social grammar remains recognizable: hosts prepare, guests
witness, and gifts circulate with remembered histories attached. Importantly, potlatch is
also a site where tradition is negotiated. Elders may debate what counts as appropriate
giving, and younger members may reinterpret prestige in ways that reflect wage labor and
modern schooling. The ceremony is therefore not a frozen relic; it is a living institution
that adapts while insisting on continuity.

For observers, the lesson is not that one should romanticize potlatch as pure generosity.
The competitive dimension can be intense, and the pressure to give can strain households.
Yet the system illustrates a broader point: economic behavior is not universal bookkeeping
applied everywhere, but a repertoire shaped by values and by social structure. [C] Where
prestige is earned through visible distribution, wealth can be mobilized to create
relationships rather than to accumulate quietly.

Potlatch, then, is best understood as a public language of exchange. [D] It converts
material goods into witnessed commitments, and it makes status legible by making giving
visible.

Even in contemporary revival ceremonies, the giving is seldom “free”; it is remembered,
compared, and reinterpreted in later exchanges.

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Along the Northwest Coast of North America, where salmon runs could be abundant and cedar forests provided durable materials, many Indigenous societies developed complex systems of rank, ceremony, and exchange.
   A. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to giving and goods
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across ceremony
   C. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   D. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of ceremony

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage presents goods as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once giving is observed, competing explanations for potlatch collapse. It treats ceremony as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   B. The passage surveys potlatch but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed goods first, with giving serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats ceremony as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation.
   C. The passage explains potlatch by linking giving to goods, and it shows why ceremony changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.
   D. The passage concedes that giving is often incomplete and concludes that potlatch cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since ceremony overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of goods with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts, in the cases described.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. A persuasive account would predict how potlatch should change if ceremony is altered, instead of assuming that giving has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to goods must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   B. The passage implies that ceremony mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes giving effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of goods no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain potlatch, especially regarding later, within the passage’s scope, in the context of the passage.
   C. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in ceremony, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of giving is enough to validate goods for potlatch.
   D. The passage treats giving primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over goods are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about potlatch are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of potlatch as a factor influencing giving
   B. discussion of goods as a factor influencing giving, in the setting discussed.
   C. discussion of ceremony as a factor influencing giving
   D. discussion of radiocarbon reservoir effects as a factor influencing giving

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Along the Northwest Coast of North America, where salmon runs could be abundant and cedar forests provided durable materials, many Indigenous societies developed complex systems of rank, ceremony, and exchange.
   A. Along the Northwest Coast of North America. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   B. Along the Northwest Coast of North America. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.
   D. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because giving directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding potlatch.
   B. Because comparability prevents goods from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold ceremony constant while examining giving.
   C. Because once giving fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and ceremony can be ignored without changing conclusions about potlatch.
   D. Because the presence of goods guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in ceremony are merely stylistic noise.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | giving | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | ceremony | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   B. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   C. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   D. It proves goods is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that potlatch should be read alongside ceremony, because giving alone does not settle what goods means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: These interpretations do not cancel one another, because potlatch operated simultaneously as material transfer, political theater, and narrative performance.
   A. the preceding claim about how giving is interpreted in relation to goods
   B. the preceding claim that ceremony alone explains the outcome of potlatch
   C. the preceding claim that potlatch functions as a direct measurement of goods
   D. the preceding claim that giving is included only for rhetorical style, not analysis

10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to show that the term potlatch belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of giving lead to different conclusions about potlatch.
   C. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses goods, so debate over giving is unnecessary noise, in the examples provided.
   D. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of giving and goods should be abandoned altogether, under the stated assumptions.
