Passage 0063: Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces (Chemistry)
======================================================================
(Word count: 734)

In operando measurement campaigns, one sees why researchers have treated rate enhancement as
the decisive sign of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces. To be sure, DFT surface
modeling can make the pattern look unusually sharp, yet the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for, a move that forces
analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

To be sure, the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, yet the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how support
interactions can shift baselines, altering whether rate enhancement is even comparable
across cases; this, in turn, means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation.
Should support interactions is changed while the nominal driver remains constant be true,
one should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed. In this sense, surface-
mediated catalysis on pt is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Only through analysts began combining DFT surface modeling with cross-site comparisons could
one reasonably claim that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which rate enhancement could be explained in more than one way
because, as the author notes, confounders like support interactions often co-vary with the
driver. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than
a stylistic choice, which helps explain why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on support interactions, it is difficult to
deny that many early studies framed heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces as a
single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] The author suggests that the same evidence can support
multiple stories when priors differ. Whereas those studies emphasized rate enhancement as a
signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same signature survives when
protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under replication. [B] The passage
returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence. this shift mattered for how
evidence from electrochemical interfaces was generalized because, as the author notes, local
conditions can change which processes generate rate enhancement. [C] The author uses the
example to separate detection from interpretation. [D] The author implies that replication
is informative only when protocols are comparable. In this sense, platinum-catalyzed
reaction pathways is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces: inference is constrained by what
competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to explanation
holds, then the same observation—rate enhancement—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat rate enhancement as an
endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify support interactions could
one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which DFT surface modeling constrains alternatives,
researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Granted that a single case
can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, metal-surface catalytic conversion is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces
be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which
forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories
without implying that any story is arbitrary. Though the temptation to treat a tidy plot as
a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which rate enhancement is
interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. selectivity shifts
   B. Heterogeneous Catalysis on Platinum Surfaces
   C. microkinetic modeling
   D. a recipe for bread fermentation

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways is settled because poisoning by CO uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that adsorbate coverage effects is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using DFT surface modeling are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats DFT surface modeling as a historical curiosity and does not discuss poisoning by CO or adsorbate coverage effects. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces and argues that poisoning by CO is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how adsorbate coverage effects can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from laboratory single-crystal studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining DFT surface modeling with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about surface-mediated catalysis on pt robust.
   D. The passage argues that metal-surface catalytic conversion cannot be studied empirically because confounders like adsorbate coverage effects make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting DFT surface modeling as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

3. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once rate enhancement is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if in situ spectroscopy produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. The passage implies that in situ spectroscopy directly measures causes, meaning confounding from support interactions is impossible.
   D. it prevents rate enhancement from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control support interactions

4. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when facet dependence can mimic selectivity shifts.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving surface microscopy.
   C. The author treats laboratory single-crystal studies as a special case and argues that no broader inference about heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces is possible.
   D. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away facet dependence, since variability is merely a measurement error.

5. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. The author argues that temperature-programmed desorption should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where temperature-programmed desorption constrains support interactions
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'platinum-catalyzed reaction pathways' refers to a different field altogether, not to heterogeneous catalysis on platinum surfaces.
   D. The discussion suggests that support interactions is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on temperature-programmed desorption simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates facet dependence.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because rate enhancement uniquely identifies one mechanism.
