Passage 0063: Potlatch as Public Exchange, Prestige, and Memory in Northwest Coast Societies (Anthropology)
===========================================================================================================
(Word count: 605)

Along the Northwest Coast of North America, where salmon runs could be abundant and cedar
forests provided durable materials, many Indigenous societies developed complex systems of
rank, ceremony, and exchange. Among the best-known ceremonial practices was the potlatch, a
gathering in which hosts distributed gifts—blankets, food, carved objects, later even
manufactured goods—to guests from other groups. To outsiders who equated value with
accumulation, the practice looked irrational: why would a leader give away wealth? Yet to
participants, potlatch was a logic of prestige, obligation, and memory.

A potlatch was not simply a feast with generous presents. It was often staged to mark events
such as marriages, births, deaths, or the inheritance of names and rights. When a host
distributed goods, the act publicly asserted the host’s status and validated claims to
titles or privileges. Guests, in turn, witnessed the claims and accepted gifts that created
reciprocal debts. A future potlatch would be expected, and the ability to repay—often with
interest, by giving more than one had received— became part of the competitive display. [A]
What looks like “waste” from one accounting system becomes investment in social recognition
in another.

Anthropologists debated how to interpret potlatch. Some emphasized ecology, noting that
coastal abundance allowed storage and redistribution; others emphasized politics, arguing
that potlatch stabilized hierarchy by binding followers and rivals into obligations. Later
scholars, wary of treating ceremony as mere economics, focused on meaning: the songs,
dances, and speeches that encoded history and law. A carved crest displayed at a potlatch
could be a legal argument, not only an aesthetic one. These interpretations do not cancel
one another, because potlatch operated simultaneously as material transfer, political
theater, and narrative performance.

The practice also became a flashpoint under colonial rule. In Canada, for example, officials
and missionaries criticized potlatch as disruptive and attempted to suppress it, viewing it
as an obstacle to assimilation. Legal bans were imposed, though enforcement varied and
communities found ways to adapt—holding smaller gatherings, disguising ceremonies as
holidays, or shifting what was given. The suppression itself altered the system: when public
distribution is constrained, the public validation of rank is constrained as well. [B]
Ironically, an attempt to eliminate the practice sometimes increased the stakes of the
occasions that could still be held, because they became rarer opportunities to reaffirm
identity.

In contemporary contexts, potlatch persists and evolves. Some communities have revived large
ceremonies, while others emphasize family-based events. Cash and store-bought goods can now
be part of giving, yet the social grammar remains recognizable: hosts prepare, guests
witness, and gifts circulate with remembered histories attached. Importantly, potlatch is
also a site where tradition is negotiated. Elders may debate what counts as appropriate
giving, and younger members may reinterpret prestige in ways that reflect wage labor and
modern schooling. The ceremony is therefore not a frozen relic; it is a living institution
that adapts while insisting on continuity.

For observers, the lesson is not that one should romanticize potlatch as pure generosity.
The competitive dimension can be intense, and the pressure to give can strain households.
Yet the system illustrates a broader point: economic behavior is not universal bookkeeping
applied everywhere, but a repertoire shaped by values and by social structure. [C] Where
prestige is earned through visible distribution, wealth can be mobilized to create
relationships rather than to accumulate quietly.

Potlatch, then, is best understood as a public language of exchange. [D] It converts
material goods into witnessed commitments, and it makes status legible by making giving
visible.

Even in contemporary revival ceremonies, the giving is seldom “free”; it is remembered,
compared, and reinterpreted in later exchanges.

Questions
---------
1. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author say that what looks like “waste” can be “investment” in potlatch?
   A. even though giving publicly can build prestige and reciprocal obligations that function as social capital. This outcome would hold even if later stays constant.
   B. Because giving publicly must build prestige and reciprocal obligations that function as social capital. This would require communities to be the limiting factor.
   C. Because giving publicly can build prestige and reciprocal obligations that function as social capital.
   D. Because giving publicly can build anthropology and reciprocal obligations that function as social capital. That would make northwest the primary constraint.


2. [Factual] According to the passage, potlatches were often held to mark events such as:
   A. marriages, deaths, and the inheritance of names and rights by tying the effect to later. That would make memory the primary constraint.
   B. marriages, deaths, and the inheritance of names and rights.
   C. marriages, deaths, and the inheritance of names and rights. This would occur only when where dominates.
   D. marriages, deaths, and the inheritance of names and rights. This would require distribution to be the limiting factor.


3. [Inference] What can be inferred about how colonial suppression affected potlatch practices?
   A. It forced communities to adapt ceremonies and changed the conditions under which public validation of rank could occur. This outcome would hold even if communities stays constant.
   B. It forced communities to adapt ceremonies and changed the conditions under which public validation of rank could occur.
   C. It forced communities to adapt ceremonies and changed the conditions under which public validation of rank could occur. This outcome would hold even if along stays constant.
   D. It forced north to adapt ceremonies and changed the conditions under which public validation of rank could occur. That would make north the primary constraint.


4. [Sentence Insert] Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The exchange, then, was simultaneously material and symbolic, because it made authority publicly credible.
   A. [A]
   B. [D]
   C. [C]
   D. [B]


5. [Vocabulary] The word “repertoire” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. a carved crest displayed on a pole
   B. a legal ban imposed by the state
   C. a set of practices or behaviors available within a culture
   D. a single rule that never changes


6. [Negative Factual] All of the following are mentioned as scholarly interpretations of potlatch EXCEPT:
   A. interpretations focusing on ceremony as meaning and law.
   B. claims that potlatch is a photosynthetic pathway used by succulents.
   C. political explanations emphasizing hierarchy and obligation in this discussion.
   D. ecological explanations emphasizing abundance and storage in this discussion.


7. [Reference] In the passage, “the system” refers to:
   A. the potlatch institution of public giving and reciprocal expectation.
   B. the potlatch institution of public giving and reciprocal expectation. This outcome would hold even if memory stays constant.
   C. the potlatch institution of public giving and reciprocal expectation. That would make north the primary constraint.
   D. the where institution of public giving and reciprocal expectation. That would make best-known the primary constraint.


8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces potlatch and its apparent paradox, explains social functions and debates about interpretation, then discusses colonial suppression, contemporary adaptation, and broader implications about value.
   B. It introduces potlatch and its apparent paradox, explains social functions and debates about interpretation, then discusses colonial suppression, contemporary adaptation, and broader implications about value. This would require north to be the limiting factor.
   C. It introduces anthropologists and its apparent paradox, explains social functions and debates about interpretation, then discusses colonial suppression, contemporary adaptation, and broader implications about value. This outcome would hold even if canada stays constant.
   D. It introduces potlatch and its apparent paradox, explains social functions and debates about interpretation, then discusses colonial suppression, contemporary adaptation, and broader implications about value. This would require memory to be the limiting factor.


9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the idea that potlatch makes status “legible”?
   A. Public distribution turns claims of rank into observable actions that others can solely witness and remember. This would require prestige to be the limiting factor.
   B. Public distribution turns claims of rank into observable actions that others can witness and remember.
   C. Public distribution turns claims of rank into observable actions that others must witness and remember. This outcome would hold even if prestige stays constant.
   D. Public societies turns claims of rank into observable actions that others can witness and remember. That would make best-known the primary constraint.


10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. The passage explains potlatch as a ceremonial system in which public gift distribution asserts status, creates reciprocal obligations, and encodes history and law; it notes anthropological debates, the disruptive effects of colonial suppression and adaptation, and the way contemporary communities continue to negotiate tradition while using exchange to make relationships and rank visible. This would occur only when best-known dominates.
   B. The passage explains potlatch as a ceremonial system in which public gift distribution asserts status, creates reciprocal obligations, and encodes history and law; it notes anthropological debates, the disruptive effects of colonial suppression and adaptation, and the way contemporary communities continue to negotiate tradition while using exchange to make relationships and rank visible.
