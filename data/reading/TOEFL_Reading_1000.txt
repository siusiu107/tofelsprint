Passage 1000: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 748)

In replication efforts, the analysis suggests researchers have treated increased liking for
chosen options as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. Although choice-induced preference paradigms can make the pattern look
unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned
by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about
what the data are evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency was it defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive rather
than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which choice-induced preference paradigms
constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample;
this, in turn, is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars.
Despite the fact that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of
striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, post-
choice attitude change is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about
consistency did the earlier interpretation begin to look fragile, so the debate became
empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which choice-
induced preference paradigms constrains alternatives, researchers could ask which
predictions survive out of sample, something that is why the passage emphasizes comparative
design over isolated exemplars. Although a single case can be dramatic, the author does not
deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as representative.

What matters most is methodological humility, which is why the passage presents as the
lesson of cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained
by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from description to
explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same observation—increased liking for
chosen options—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat increased liking for chosen options as an endpoint is easy
to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. In this sense,
dissonance reduction after decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label.

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike workplace decision settings. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because cultural
norms about consistency shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. So the
author therefore separates detection from interpretation, and so, too, does the evidence
undermine treating increased liking for chosen options as a self-sufficient conclusion.

Only after analysts began combining choice-induced preference paradigms with cross-site
comparisons did claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. [A] The author
shifts from narrative to diagnosis, focusing on what the data cannot rule out. the goal was
to break degeneracies in which increased liking for chosen options could be explained in
more than one way because confounders like cultural norms about consistency often co-vary
with the driver, which is why replication matters. [B] The author notes that generalization
requires more than a single well-chosen case. as the author notes, transparency about priors
became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, something that changes whether two
analyses are actually comparable. [C] The passage returns to this point to clarify what
counts as evidence. [D] The argument hinges on what would change under an alternative
explanation. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best treated as a conditional
inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely: the passage concludes
that the most informative evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions
into the open. by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for
discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield
multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Despite the fact that the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which increased liking for chosen options is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author treats consumer choice studies as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when public versus private commitment can mimic increased liking for chosen options.
   C. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving meta-analytic synthesis.
   D. The passage suggests that increased liking for chosen options is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.

2. [Reference] In the passage, the word **it** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about consistency was it defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical.
   A. measurement reactivity alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. choice-induced preference paradigms as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. shifted confidence judgments specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **coherent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Despite the fact that the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework in which increased liking for chosen options is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like behavioral priming designs are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because self-concept threat dominates all evidence
   C. well organized
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

4. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that measurement reactivity is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using implicit association tests are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats implicit association tests as a historical curiosity and does not discuss devaluation of rejected alternatives or measurement reactivity. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like measurement reactivity make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting implicit association tests as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that devaluation of rejected alternatives is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how measurement reactivity can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from consumer choice studies. Finally, it maintains that tests combining implicit association tests with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | implicit association tests | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | devaluation of rejected alternatives | Can be degenerate with another effect |
   | Confounder | self-concept threat | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. Can be degenerate with another effect
   B. Shifts the baseline
   C. Requires careful calibration
   D. It proves selective memory for supporting evidence is unique.

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] What function does the comparison with another theory perform in the argument?
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where longitudinal attitude surveys constrains measurement reactivity
   B. The author argues that longitudinal attitude surveys should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage implies that consumer choice studies is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   D. The discussion suggests that measurement reactivity is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.

7. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because cultural norms about consistency co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. The passage implies that longitudinal attitude surveys directly measures causes, meaning confounding from cultural norms about consistency is impossible.
   C. Since devaluation of rejected alternatives is observed in consumer choice studies, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. it prevents devaluation of rejected alternatives from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control cultural norms about consistency

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on behavioral priming designs simple.
   B. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates measurement reactivity.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because devaluation of rejected alternatives uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in cross-national survey samples and everywhere else.

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
