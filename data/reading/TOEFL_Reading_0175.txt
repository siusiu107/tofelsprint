Passage 0175: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 751)

When archival records are combined, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated
changes in neighborhood composition as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern
urban transformation. While it is true that labor market inference from wage series can make
the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and
must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection
than about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate
boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Not until the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify wartime industry demand did
the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases
in which labor market inference from wage series constrains alternatives, researchers could
ask which predictions survive out of sample, which forces analysts to admit that is why the
passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can
be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, african american internal migration is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference
is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—changes in neighborhood
composition—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat changes in neighborhood composition as an endpoint looks
decisive, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or
observational contrasts becomes more predictive under replication.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on wartime industry demand, the argument
reframes the issue so that many early studies framed the great migration and northern urban
transformation as a single-mechanism phenomenon. Whereas those studies emphasized changes in
neighborhood composition as a signature is easy to measure, later work asked whether the
same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ is harder to interpret without
assumptions. The passage argues that this shift mattered for how evidence from Chicago was
generalized because local conditions can change which processes generate changes in
neighborhood composition. In this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated
as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Using labor market inference from wage series under stable conditions, one frequently cited
case from Chicago appeared to support the direct-readout view. Granted that the original fit
looked visually decisive, later, however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in wartime
industry demand altered the baseline enough to mute or mimic changes in neighborhood
composition. the passage treats this episode as diagnostic, something that illustrates why
boundary conditions must be specified before generalization is attempted.

Only when analysts began combining labor market inference from wage series with cross-site
comparisons did claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. [A] The
discussion makes clear that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which changes in neighborhood composition could be explained in more
than one way in part because confounders like wartime industry demand often co-vary with the
driver. [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test. as the
author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic
choice, a move that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. [C] The passage
returns to this point to clarify what counts as evidence. [D] The passage signals that a
tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration
flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, researchers found that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. To be
sure, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, yet the result
is a framework in which changes in neighborhood composition is interpreted through explicit
boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. housing record reconstruction as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   B. shifts in industrial labor demand specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. racial violence and intimidation alone, treated as the sole cause

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because political realignment patterns uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that housing covenants and policy constraints is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using census microdata analysis are unnecessary.
   B. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like housing covenants and policy constraints make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting census microdata analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats census microdata analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss political realignment patterns or housing covenants and policy constraints. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that political realignment patterns is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how housing covenants and policy constraints can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Chicago. Finally, it maintains that tests combining census microdata analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. the length of the Nile in miles
   B. political realignment patterns
   C. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation
   D. census microdata analysis

4. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author’s discussion of an alternative hypothesis serves mainly to:
   A. The passage implies that Harlem is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author argues that housing record reconstruction should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The author suggests that the key synonym 'African American internal migration' refers to a different field altogether, not to the great migration and northern urban transformation.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where housing record reconstruction constrains push–pull dynamics

5. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | housing record reconstruction | Depends on modeling priors |
   | Signal | segregation and redlining signatures | May be sensitive to preprocessing choices |
   | Confounder | wartime industry demand | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Shifts the baseline
   B. It makes wartime industry demand irrelevant.
   C. It proves political realignment patterns is unique.
   D. It replaces housing record reconstruction with intuition.

6. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: In other words, the disagreement is not about whether the data exist, but about what the data are evidence for.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

7. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: If one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—changes in neighborhood composition—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
   A. important
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like newspaper archive research are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because racial violence and intimidation dominates all evidence
   D. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail

8. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that model assumptions is important mainly because:
   A. Because wartime industry demand co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents shifts in industrial labor demand from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control wartime industry demand
   C. Since shifts in industrial labor demand is observed in Detroit, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. Because shifts in industrial labor demand appears, the mechanism must be unique, so wartime industry demand can be ignored as irrelevant noise.

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates push–pull dynamics.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because political realignment patterns uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Detroit and everywhere else.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on oral history synthesis simple.

10. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving census microdata analysis.
   B. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using census microdata analysis.
   C. The author treats Detroit as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
   D. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when racial violence and intimidation can mimic shifts in industrial labor demand.
