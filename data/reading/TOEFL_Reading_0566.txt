Passage 0566: Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves (Ecology)
=====================================================================
(Word count: 736)

In cross-site comparisons, researchers found that researchers have treated reduced
photosynthetic efficiency as the decisive sign of coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves. reef-scale temperature loggers can make the pattern look unusually sharp; still,
the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for; this, in turn, forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than
rely on familiar narratives.

It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that the passage
presents as the lesson of coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from
description to explanation, then the same observation—reduced photosynthetic efficiency—must
be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed
with confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat reduced photosynthetic efficiency as an
endpoint is easy to measure, the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper
experimental or observational contrasts is harder to interpret without assumptions. In this
sense, thermal bleaching events is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Seldom, prior to the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify shading and cooling
refugia, did investigators concede that the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which reef-scale temperature loggers constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn,
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. While it is true
that a single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative.

Only through the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify shading and cooling refugia
could one reasonably claim that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which reef-scale temperature loggers constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, which helps
explain why is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. a
single case can be dramatic; still, the author does not deny the value of striking examples,
but warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, loss of symbiotic
zooxanthellae under heat stress is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a
mere label.

Seldom, prior to analysts began combining reef-scale temperature loggers with cross-site
comparisons, did investigators concede that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine
heatwaves stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
[A] The passage highlights that mechanism claims must survive out-of-sample checks. the goal
was to break degeneracies in which reduced photosynthetic efficiency could be explained in
more than one way because confounders like shading and cooling refugia often co-vary with
the driver. [B] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts what is measured with what is
inferred. as the author notes, transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather
than a stylistic choice, which is precisely why changes whether two analyses are actually
comparable. [C] This is presented not as a loophole, but as a disciplined way to avoid
overclaiming. [D] The passage signals that a tidy fit may hide degenerate explanations.

In replication attempts, the analysis suggests the apparent consensus fractured when similar
protocols were applied in settings unlike Red Sea reefs. the same summary statistic could be
reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed largely because shading and cooling
refugia shifted the baseline in different directions across sites. the author therefore
separates detection from interpretation, not because treating reduced photosynthetic
efficiency as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ. In this
sense, reef-scale bleaching episodes is best treated as a conditional inference rather than
as a mere label.

In the end, the analysis suggests the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors,
it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same
record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. Even if the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is a framework
in which reduced photosynthetic efficiency is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Great Barrier Reef and everywhere else.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because recruitment failure uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates local adaptation.
   D. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on photophysiology measurements simple.

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves and argues that reduced photosynthetic efficiency is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how compound stressors such as acidification and pollution can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Coral Triangle. Finally, it maintains that tests combining degree-heating-week metrics with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about thermal bleaching events robust.
   B. The passage claims that loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress is settled because reduced photosynthetic efficiency uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that compound stressors such as acidification and pollution is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using degree-heating-week metrics are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats degree-heating-week metrics as a historical curiosity and does not discuss reduced photosynthetic efficiency or compound stressors such as acidification and pollution. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that reef-scale bleaching episodes cannot be studied empirically because confounders like compound stressors such as acidification and pollution make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting degree-heating-week metrics as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

3. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **salient** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the author therefore separates detection from interpretation, not because treating reduced photosynthetic efficiency as a self-sufficient conclusion, but because the assumptions differ.
   A. irrelevant to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves, serving only as background detail
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because compound stressors such as acidification and pollution dominates all evidence
   C. important
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like symbiont genotyping are needed

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?

   C. Coral Bleaching Triggered by Marine Heatwaves
   D. mortality and phase shifts

6. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when compound stressors such as acidification and pollution can mimic shifts in carbonate accretion.
   B. The passage suggests that shifts in carbonate accretion is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   C. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away compound stressors such as acidification and pollution, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving degree-heating-week metrics.

7. [Rhetorical Purpose] In referring to a contrasting interpretation, the author intends to:
   A. The author argues that photophysiology measurements should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   B. The passage treats shifts in carbonate accretion as a confounder and compound stressors such as acidification and pollution as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where photophysiology measurements constrains compound stressors such as acidification and pollution
   D. The author suggests that the key synonym 'loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae under heat stress' refers to a different field altogether, not to coral bleaching triggered by marine heatwaves.

8. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
