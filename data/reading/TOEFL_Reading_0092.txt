Passage 0092: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 649)

Despite seemingly clear effect sizes, the central disagreement can be stated more precisely:
researchers have treated increased liking for chosen options as the decisive sign of
cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization. While it is true that longitudinal
attitude surveys can make the pattern look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such
confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate
is less about data collection than about what the data are evidence for; this, in turn,
forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Though the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how cultural norms
about consistency can shift baselines, altering whether increased liking for chosen options
is even comparable across cases, which is precisely why means that a good fit is not the
same as a good explanation. Were cultural norms about consistency is changed while the
nominal driver remains constant to fail, one should expect different outcomes when
conditions are perturbed. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Working with sparse records and limited controls on cultural norms about consistency, the
key question becomes whether many early studies framed cognitive dissonance and post-
decision rationalization as a single-mechanism phenomenon. [A] The author uses the example
to separate detection from interpretation. Whereas those studies emphasized increased liking
for chosen options as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same
signature survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under
replication. [B] The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols are
comparable. this shift mattered for how evidence from political opinion panels was
generalized largely because local conditions can change which processes generate increased
liking for chosen options. [C] The argument hinges on what would change under an alternative
explanation. [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing
models would also predict. Were one wishes to move from description to explanation to fail,
then the same observation—increased liking for chosen options—must be paired with tests that
change the conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat increased
liking for chosen options as an endpoint, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts. In this sense, dissonance reduction after
decisions is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Only by the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify cultural norms about consistency
was the field forced to accept that the debate became empirically productive rather than
merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in which longitudinal attitude surveys constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample, an outcome that
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Granted that a
single case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but
warns against treating them as representative. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Admittedly, the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong;
nevertheless, the result is a framework in which increased liking for chosen options is
interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage suggests that increased liking for chosen options is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving longitudinal attitude surveys.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when cultural norms about consistency can mimic increased liking for chosen options.
   D. The author treats cross-national survey samples as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.

2. [Rhetorical Purpose] The author introduces rival explanations chiefly to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where choice-induced preference paradigms constrains cultural norms about consistency
   B. The passage treats shifted confidence judgments as a confounder and cultural norms about consistency as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   C. The discussion suggests that cultural norms about consistency is the phenomenon itself, so controlling for it would remove the effect of interest.
   D. The author argues that choice-induced preference paradigms should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.

3. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | behavioral priming designs | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | shifted confidence judgments | Can vary across epochs |
   | Confounder | self-concept threat | Shifts the baseline |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It replaces implicit association tests with intuition.
   B. Requires careful calibration
   C. Can vary across epochs
   D. Shifts the baseline

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [D] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. cultural norms about consistency alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   C. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   D. meta-analytic synthesis as a device rather than as an analytic approach

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **plausible** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Whereas those studies emphasized increased liking for chosen options as a signature looks decisive, later work asked whether the same signature survives when protocols and baselines differ becomes more predictive under replication.
   A. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because cultural norms about consistency dominates all evidence
   C. complete and final, so no further checks like implicit association tests are needed
   D. reasonable

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that confounder control is important mainly because:
   A. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if behavioral priming designs produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   B. it prevents increased liking for chosen options from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control public versus private commitment
   C. The passage implies that behavioral priming designs directly measures causes, meaning confounding from public versus private commitment is impossible.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once increased liking for chosen options is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because increased liking for chosen options uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that self-concept threat is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal attitude surveys are unnecessary.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal attitude surveys as a historical curiosity and does not discuss increased liking for chosen options or self-concept threat. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like self-concept threat make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal attitude surveys as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   D. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that increased liking for chosen options is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how self-concept threat can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from workplace decision settings. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal attitude surveys with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: The argument also suggests that disagreement can be productive, since it forces boundary conditions to be stated rather than assumed.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

9. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, an outcome that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because selective memory for supporting evidence uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on behavioral priming designs simple.
   C. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.
