Passage 0776: The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation (History)
=============================================================================
(Word count: 793)

When archival records are combined, researchers found that researchers have treated
political realignment patterns as the decisive sign of the great migration and northern
urban transformation. Even if labor market inference from wage series can make the pattern
look unusually sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be
earned by specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than
about what the data are evidence for, which forces analysts to articulate boundary
conditions rather than rely on familiar narratives. In replication attempts, researchers
found that the apparent consensus fractured when similar protocols were applied in settings
unlike Harlem. The passage argues that the same summary statistic could be reproduced while
the underlying mechanisms differed because housing covenants and policy constraints shifted
the baseline in different directions across sites. The issue is not treating political
realignment patterns as a self-sufficient conclusion; it is that the author therefore
separates detection from interpretation. In this sense, african american internal migration
is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. It is the apparent
regularity of political realignment patterns, rather than a single headline feature, that
drives the first interpretation: political realignment patterns is treated as a direct
readout of mechanism. [A] Later comparisons reveal why this matters. Provided that political
realignment patterns is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then observations from
Harlem would be transferable, and disagreement would be largely technical. [B] This becomes
a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed. Rather than the caveat that
housing covenants and policy constraints might reproduce the same pattern, the passage
emphasizes that the literature is full of such claims. [C] At first glance, the pattern
seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. [D] The author uses the example to
separate detection from interpretation. Never before the field adopted tests that manipulate
or stratify housing covenants and policy constraints was it defensible to argue that the
debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by comparing cases in
which labor market inference from wage series constrains alternatives, researchers could ask
which predictions survive out of sample, which is precisely why is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. a single case can be dramatic; still,
the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against treating them as
representative. It is methodological humility, rather than a single headline feature, that
the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation:
inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. If one wishes to move
from description to explanation, a different prediction follows: then the same
observation—political realignment patterns—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears. Whereas popular summaries treat political realignment
patterns as an endpoint invites a tidy story, the passage treats it as a starting point for
sharper experimental or observational contrasts forces boundary conditions to be stated. In
this sense, south-to-north population movement is best treated as a conditional inference
rather than as a mere label. The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is
stated, the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban
transformation: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict. Unless
one wishes to move from description to explanation, then the same observation—political
realignment patterns—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it
appears cannot be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular summaries treat political
realignment patterns as an endpoint in one account, the passage treats it as a starting
point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts in another. Never before the field
adopted tests that manipulate or stratify housing covenants and policy constraints was it
defensible to argue that the debate became empirically productive rather than merely
rhetorical. by comparing cases in which labor market inference from wage series constrains
alternatives, researchers could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn,
is why the passage emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Although a single
case can be dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns
against treating them as representative. In this sense, twentieth-century black migration
flows is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label. In the end,
the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence is often
the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that claims about
the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it
turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies
why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.

Questions
---------

1. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about the great migration and northern urban transformation be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, which forces analysts to admit that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates housing covenants and policy constraints.
   B. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because political realignment patterns uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on census microdata analysis simple.
   D. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in Harlem and everywhere else.

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that twentieth-century black migration flows cannot be studied empirically because confounders like push–pull dynamics make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting census microdata analysis as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage claims that south-to-north population movement is settled because shifts in industrial labor demand uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that push–pull dynamics is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using census microdata analysis are unnecessary.
   C. The passage examines the great migration and northern urban transformation and argues that shifts in industrial labor demand is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how push–pull dynamics can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from Detroit. Finally, it maintains that tests combining census microdata analysis with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about african american internal migration robust.
   D. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats census microdata analysis as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifts in industrial labor demand or push–pull dynamics. It ends without any methodological implication.

3. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the inference is underdetermined, the most informative tests are those that break degeneracies rather than those that merely sharpen one feature.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This becomes a pivot point where the earlier interpretation is narrowed.
   A. wartime industry demand alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   C. newspaper archive research as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. changes in neighborhood composition specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **idiosyncratic** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: The decisive factor is methodological humility; once that is stated, the passage presents as the lesson of the great migration and northern urban transformation: inference is constrained by what competing models would also predict.
   A. peculiar to one case
   B. irrelevant to the great migration and northern urban transformation, serving only as background detail
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because racial violence and intimidation dominates all evidence
   D. complete and final, so no further checks like labor market inference from wage series are needed

6. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | census microdata analysis | Requires careful calibration |
   | Signal | shifts in industrial labor demand | Can be contaminated by background variability |
   | Confounder | push–pull dynamics | Adds correlated noise |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Confounder' is ________.
   A. Requires careful calibration
   B. Can be contaminated by background variability
   C. It proves political realignment patterns is unique.
   D. Adds correlated noise

7. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize instrument calibration?
   A. it prevents segregation and redlining signatures from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control wartime industry demand
   B. The discussion indicates that replication is redundant if newspaper archive research produces a tight fit on one dataset.
   C. The passage implies that newspaper archive research directly measures causes, meaning confounding from wartime industry demand is impossible.
   D. The author suggests that disagreement disappears once segregation and redlining signatures is detected, making model assumptions unnecessary.

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the passage juxtapose two accounts of the phenomenon?
   A. The passage implies that Philadelphia is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author argues that newspaper archive research should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage treats segregation and redlining signatures as a confounder and housing covenants and policy constraints as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where newspaper archive research constrains housing covenants and policy constraints

9. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. census microdata analysis
   B. segregation and redlining signatures
   C. a list of Olympic medal counts
   D. The Great Migration and Northern Urban Transformation

10. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving housing record reconstruction.
   B. The passage claims that the best strategy is to average away push–pull dynamics, since variability is merely a measurement error.
   C. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when push–pull dynamics can mimic segregation and redlining signatures.
   D. The author treats Detroit as a special case and argues that no broader inference about the great migration and northern urban transformation is possible.
