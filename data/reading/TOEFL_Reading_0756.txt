Passage 0756: Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization (Psychology)
=================================================================================
(Word count: 713)

Despite seemingly clear effect sizes, it becomes plausible that researchers have treated
shifted confidence judgments as the decisive sign of cognitive dissonance and post-decision
rationalization. Although implicit association tests can make the pattern look unusually
sharp, the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by
specifying assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what
the data are evidence for, something that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions
rather than rely on familiar narratives.

Hardly had analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-site comparisons
occurred when claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped
relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions. [A] At first
glance, the pattern seems obvious, yet the author frames it as conditional. the goal was to
break degeneracies in which shifted confidence judgments could be explained in more than one
way because confounders like measurement reactivity often co-vary with the driver. [B] This
point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline. as the author notes,
transparency about priors became an empirical issue rather than a stylistic choice, a move
that changes whether two analyses are actually comparable. [C] The discussion makes clear
that measurement choices can masquerade as mechanism. [D] That point is not rhetorical; it
controls which prediction follows. In this sense, post-choice attitude change is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

It is methodological humility that the passage presents as the lesson of cognitive
dissonance and post-decision rationalization: inference is constrained by what competing
models would also predict. Unless one wishes to move from description to explanation, then
the same observation—shifted confidence judgments—must be paired with tests that change the
conditions under which it appears cannot be claimed with confidence. Whereas popular
summaries treat shifted confidence judgments as an endpoint looks decisive, the passage
treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational contrasts becomes
more predictive under replication.

Using implicit association tests under stable conditions, the key question becomes whether
one frequently cited case from workplace decision settings appeared to support the direct-
readout view. Despite the fact that the original fit looked visually decisive, later,
however, reanalysis showed that small shifts in measurement reactivity altered the baseline
enough to mute or mimic shifted confidence judgments. the passage treats this episode as
diagnostic, which is precisely why illustrates why boundary conditions must be specified
before generalization is attempted. In this sense, dissonance reduction after decisions is
best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

To be sure, the first model can fit one dataset extremely well, yet the passage insists that
uniqueness is precisely what must be shown, not assumed. it highlights how measurement
reactivity can shift baselines, altering whether shifted confidence judgments is even
comparable across cases, which means that a good fit is not the same as a good explanation.
Unless measurement reactivity is changed while the nominal driver remains constant, one
should expect different outcomes when conditions are perturbed cannot be claimed with
confidence.

It is the apparent regularity of shifted confidence judgments that drives the first
interpretation: shifted confidence judgments is treated as a direct readout of mechanism.
Unless shifted confidence judgments is uniquely produced by one causal pathway, then
observations from workplace decision settings would be transferable, and disagreement would
be largely technical cannot be claimed with confidence. So the literature is full of such
claims, and so, too, does the evidence undermine the caveat that measurement reactivity
might reproduce the same pattern. In this sense, self-justification mechanisms is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, it becomes plausible that the passage concludes that the most informative
evidence is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting
that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on
stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why
the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
Although the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong, the result is
a framework in which shifted confidence judgments is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [B] This point forces the reader to consider how confounders enter the pipeline.
   A. self-concept threat alone, treated as the sole cause
   B. longitudinal attitude surveys as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   C. selective memory for supporting evidence specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement
   D. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences

2. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **subtle** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Hardly had analysts began combining implicit association tests with cross-site comparisons occurred when claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization stopped relying on a single figure and started relying on falsifiable predictions.
   A. complete and final, so no further checks like longitudinal attitude surveys are needed
   B. unavoidable and uncontrollable because cultural norms about consistency dominates all evidence
   C. slight
   D. irrelevant to cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization, serving only as background detail

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. increased liking for chosen options
   B. a list of Olympic medal counts
   C. longitudinal attitude surveys
   D. Cognitive Dissonance and Post-Decision Rationalization

4. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Because the inference is underdetermined, the most informative tests are those that break degeneracies rather than those that merely sharpen one feature.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

5. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The author treats political opinion panels as a special case and argues that no broader inference about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization is possible.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when cultural norms about consistency can mimic devaluation of rejected alternatives.
   C. The passage suggests that devaluation of rejected alternatives is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   D. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using meta-analytic synthesis.

6. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that replication across contexts is important mainly because:
   A. Because measurement reactivity co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. The passage implies that meta-analytic synthesis directly measures causes, meaning confounding from measurement reactivity is impossible.
   C. Since devaluation of rejected alternatives is observed in cross-national survey samples, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.
   D. it prevents devaluation of rejected alternatives from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control measurement reactivity

7. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage argues that self-justification mechanisms cannot be studied empirically because confounders like cultural norms about consistency make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting longitudinal attitude surveys as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.
   B. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats longitudinal attitude surveys as a historical curiosity and does not discuss shifted confidence judgments or cultural norms about consistency. It ends without any methodological implication.
   C. The passage examines cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization and argues that shifted confidence judgments is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how cultural norms about consistency can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from cross-national survey samples. Finally, it maintains that tests combining longitudinal attitude surveys with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about post-choice attitude change robust.
   D. The passage claims that dissonance reduction after decisions is settled because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that cultural norms about consistency is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using longitudinal attitude surveys are unnecessary.

8. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about cognitive dissonance and post-decision rationalization be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery, a move that clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because shifted confidence judgments uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in political opinion panels and everywhere else.
   C. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on implicit association tests simple.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates self-concept threat.

9. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where behavioral priming designs constrains self-concept threat
   B. The author argues that behavioral priming designs should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   C. The passage treats selective memory for supporting evidence as a confounder and self-concept threat as the diagnostic signal that identifies the mechanism.
   D. The passage implies that cross-national survey samples is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
