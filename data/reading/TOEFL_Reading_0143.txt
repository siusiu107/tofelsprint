Passage 0143: Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip (Geology)
============================================================================
(Word count: 720)

Across different subduction segments, the passage argues that researchers have treated
transient surface deformation as the decisive sign of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes
and slow slip. seafloor pressure sensors can make the pattern look unusually sharp; still,
the passage argues that such confidence is conditional and must be earned by specifying
assumptions. the resulting debate is less about data collection than about what the data are
evidence for, a move that forces analysts to articulate boundary conditions rather than rely
on familiar narratives.

In replication attempts, the passage argues that the apparent consensus fractured when
similar protocols were applied in settings unlike the Chilean margin. the same summary
statistic could be reproduced while the underlying mechanisms differed because locked versus
creeping patches shifted the baseline in different directions across sites, which is why
replication matters. Not treating transient surface deformation as a self-sufficient
conclusion, but the author therefore separates detection from interpretation. In this sense,
megathrust rupture dynamics is best treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere
label.

The decisive factor is the apparent regularity of transient surface deformation; once that
is stated, drives the first interpretation: transient surface deformation is treated as a
direct readout of mechanism. [A] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a
decisive test. If transient surface deformation is uniquely produced by one causal pathway
is granted, then observations from the Chilean margin would be transferable, and
disagreement would be largely technical. [B] This is why the author repeatedly contrasts
what is measured with what is inferred. So the literature is full of such claims, and so,
too, does the evidence undermine the caveat that locked versus creeping patches might
reproduce the same pattern. [C] The passage returns to this point to clarify what counts as
evidence. [D] The author implies that replication is informative only when protocols are
comparable.

If anything is responsible, it is methodological humility, and therefore the passage
presents as the lesson of subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip: inference is
constrained by what competing models would also predict. Provided that one wishes to move
from description to explanation, then the same observation—transient surface
deformation—must be paired with tests that change the conditions under which it appears.
Whereas popular summaries treat transient surface deformation as an endpoint in one account,
the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts in another. In this sense, episodic tremor and slip is best treated as a
conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

Whereas popular summaries treat transient surface deformation as an endpoint looks decisive,
the passage treats it as a starting point for sharper experimental or observational
contrasts becomes more predictive under replication.

Only after the field adopted tests that manipulate or stratify locked versus creeping
patches did the debate became empirically productive rather than merely rhetorical. by
comparing cases in which seafloor pressure sensors constrains alternatives, researchers
could ask which predictions survive out of sample; this, in turn, is why the passage
emphasizes comparative design over isolated exemplars. Even though a single case can be
dramatic, the author does not deny the value of striking examples, but warns against
treating them as representative. In this sense, slow-slip events on plate interfaces is best
treated as a conditional inference rather than as a mere label.

In the end, the passage argues that the passage concludes that the most informative evidence
is often the evidence that forces competing assumptions into the open. by insisting that
claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated
priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the
same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary. the
temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; still, the result is a
framework in which transient surface deformation is interpreted through explicit boundary
conditions rather than through habit.

Questions
---------

1. [Reference] In the passage, the word **This** in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: [A] This reasoning matters because it changes what counts as a decisive test.
   A. the idea being discussed in the surrounding sentences
   B. stress transfer after large events alone, treated as the sole cause
   C. continuous GPS geodesy as a device rather than as an analytic approach
   D. tsunami-generating seafloor uplift specifically, taken as an unambiguous measurement

2. [Inference] Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
   A. The passage suggests that tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is primarily a rhetorical device rather than an empirical constraint on models.
   B. A convincing explanation should make distinct predictions under shared protocols, especially when heterogeneous frictional properties can mimic tsunami-generating seafloor uplift.
   C. The argument is that boundary conditions matter only for older studies, not for modern measurements using numerical rupture simulations.
   D. The author implies that the mechanism can be decided by vocabulary choices, not by tests involving numerical rupture simulations.

3. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. low-frequency tremor bursts
   B. inversion of seismic waveforms
   C. the price of coal in 1700
   D. Subduction-Zone Megathrust Earthquakes and Slow Slip

4. [Factual Information] The passage indicates that model assumptions is important mainly because:
   A. Because locked versus creeping patches co-varies with the driver, the passage treats it as proof of mechanism rather than as a confounder.
   B. it prevents low-frequency tremor bursts from being treated as a self-interpreting fingerprint and forces tests that control locked versus creeping patches
   C. The passage implies that continuous GPS geodesy directly measures causes, meaning confounding from locked versus creeping patches is impossible.
   D. Since low-frequency tremor bursts is observed in Sumatra–Andaman, it must generalize to every setting, regardless of boundary conditions.

5. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word **convergent** in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: the temptation to treat a tidy plot as a definitive answer is strong; still, the result is a framework in which transient surface deformation is interpreted through explicit boundary conditions rather than through habit.
   A. irrelevant to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip, serving only as background detail
   B. complete and final, so no further checks like numerical rupture simulations are needed
   C. unavoidable and uncontrollable because heterogeneous frictional properties dominates all evidence
   D. coming together

6. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage examines subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip and argues that tsunami-generating seafloor uplift is not self-interpreting unless assumptions are stated explicitly. It contrasts interpretations by emphasizing how heterogeneous frictional properties can shift the baseline, especially when evidence is drawn from the Cascadia subduction zone. Finally, it maintains that tests combining seafloor pressure sensors with boundary-condition checks are required to make claims about megathrust rupture dynamics robust.
   B. The passage claims that episodic tremor and slip is settled because tsunami-generating seafloor uplift uniquely identifies the mechanism. It argues that heterogeneous frictional properties is merely noise and should be ignored. It concludes that a single measurement is sufficient, so further tests using seafloor pressure sensors are unnecessary.
   C. The passage is mainly a chronological biography of researchers rather than an argument about evidence. It treats seafloor pressure sensors as a historical curiosity and does not discuss tsunami-generating seafloor uplift or heterogeneous frictional properties. It ends without any methodological implication.
   D. The passage argues that slow-slip events on plate interfaces cannot be studied empirically because confounders like heterogeneous frictional properties make data meaningless. It recommends replacing measurement with intuition and rejecting seafloor pressure sensors as unreliable. It concludes that debate persists because evidence never constrains theory.

7. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence below?
   Sentence: by insisting that claims about subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip be conditional on stated priors, it turns disagreement into a tool for discovery; this, in turn, clarifies why the same record can yield multiple stories without implying that any story is arbitrary.
   A. Incompatible cases should be ignored to keep an explanation based on numerical rupture simulations simple.
   B. Aggregation guarantees that the same mechanism operates in the Japan Trench region and everywhere else.
   C. Some summaries seem consistent because they mix incompatible cases, not because low-frequency tremor bursts uniquely identifies one mechanism.
   D. Summaries are always reliable because averaging eliminates fluid overpressure in faults.

8. [Rhetorical Purpose] The mention of alternative mechanisms is used primarily to:
   A. The passage implies that the Cascadia subduction zone is chosen to avoid bias, so comparisons across settings are unnecessary.
   B. The author suggests that the key synonym 'slow-slip events on plate interfaces' refers to a different field altogether, not to subduction-zone megathrust earthquakes and slow slip.
   C. The author argues that seafloor pressure sensors should be replaced by an unmodeled trend line because assumptions distort evidence.
   D. motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests, such as comparing cases where seafloor pressure sensors constrains heterogeneous frictional properties
