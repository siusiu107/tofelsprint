Passage 0080: Microplastics in Rivers and the Problem of Persistence
====================================================================
(Word count: 616)

Microplastics—plastic particles smaller than five millimeters—were first discussed mainly as
an ocean problem, yet rivers are often the more immediate conveyor. They collect fragments
from urban runoff, wastewater, degraded packaging, synthetic textiles, and tire wear,
funneling them through watersheds toward estuaries. Because rivers also support drinking
water supplies, fisheries, and wetlands, microplastics in freshwater raise questions that
are not only ecological but also practical: where do particles go, what do they interact
with, and can exposure be reduced?

Transport depends on size, density, and surface condition. Some particles float initially,
especially low-density polymers, but others sink or become suspended. Sunlight and abrasion
can fragment larger pieces, changing their behavior over time. Moreover, microplastics
quickly acquire biofilms—layers of bacteria and organic matter—that alter density and
stickiness. A particle that was buoyant when fresh can, after biofilm growth and mineral
attachment, settle into sediments. [A] Thus, the “life history” of a fragment matters as
much as its original polymer type.

Rivers are not smooth pipes; they are mosaics of habitats. In fast channels, turbulence
keeps particles suspended, but in slow backwaters and floodplains, sediments accumulate and
so do microplastics. During floods, stored sediments can be remobilized, creating pulses of
downstream transport. In that sense, microplastics can behave like fine silt, alternately
stored and released. This complicates monitoring: a river sampled on a calm day may appear
cleaner than the same river sampled after a storm.

Interactions with organisms are diverse. Some invertebrates ingest particles directly,
mistaking them for food, while fish can consume microplastics indirectly through prey. The
particles can cause physical irritation and can reduce feeding efficiency by occupying gut
space. More subtle concerns involve chemicals. Plastics can contain additives, and they can
sorb pollutants from water, acting as moving surfaces for hydrophobic compounds. Whether
microplastics deliver a significant chemical dose to animals depends on residence time in
the gut, the chemicals involved, and the relative importance of other exposure pathways. [B]
Even when the chemical transfer is modest, the physical presence of persistent particles can
still alter growth or behavior.

Mitigation targets sources. Wastewater treatment plants can capture many fibers, but not
all, and combined sewer overflows during storms can bypass treatment. Street sweeping and
stormwater filters can reduce tire-derived particles and fragments from urban surfaces. At
the consumer level, washing-machine filters and fabric choices can reduce microfiber
release. Because no single intervention blocks every pathway, watershed management tends to
be layered: reduce input, intercept transport, and protect sensitive habitats where
particles accumulate.

Microplastics in rivers illustrate a broader environmental pattern: the same material that
is useful because it resists decay becomes a problem because it persists. [C] The challenge
is not to “ban the river,” but to redesign systems so that persistence does not
automatically imply widespread dispersal. [D]

   Sentence to insert: That transformation helps explain why particles can shift from the water column into riverbeds and floodplain deposits.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why storm sampling may show higher microplastic loads?
   A. Floods can remobilize stored sediments and bypass wastewater treatment, creating transport pulses
   B. Storms chemically dissolve plastics, making them vanish
   C. Rivers stop flowing during storms, trapping particles upstream permanently
   D. Sampling devices fail in rain, inflating counts artificially

5. [Negative Factual] All of the following potential sources of microplastics are mentioned EXCEPT:
   A. synthetic textiles
   B. tire wear
   C. degraded packaging
   D. vowel symbols introduced into Greek from Phoenician

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author compare microplastics to fine silt?
   A. To emphasize that particles can be alternately stored in sediments and released during floods, complicating transport and monitoring
   B. To argue that plastics are geologically identical to minerals
   C. To show that silt is manufactured from polymers
   D. To suggest that microplastics are beneficial nutrients for rivers

7. [Reference] In the passage, “layered” watershed management refers to:
   A. using multiple interventions such as reducing inputs, intercepting transport, and protecting accumulation habitats
   B. stacking plastic layers to make them heavier
   C. placing filters only at river mouths
   D. letting sediments accumulate without any action

8. [Organization] How is the passage primarily organized?
   A. It introduces microplastics as a riverborne issue, explains transport and habitat storage, describes biological and chemical interactions, then outlines mitigation approaches and a broader implication about persistence
   B. It provides a recipe for making biodegradable polymers
   C. It lists only ocean currents and ignores rivers
   D. It argues that microplastics cannot be monitored

9. [Paraphrase] Which option best restates the claim that the fragment’s “life history” matters?
   A. As particles weather and acquire biofilms and minerals, their behavior changes, so initial polymer properties do not fully predict where they end up
   B. Only the original polymer density matters and never changes
   C. Life history refers to the age of fish in the river
   D. Biofilms prevent any movement of particles

10. [Summary] Which statement best summarizes the passage?
   A. Microplastics are transported only in oceans, so rivers are irrelevant.
   B. The passage explains that rivers convey microplastics from diverse sources, shows how particle behavior changes with fragmentation and biofilm growth and how river habitats store and release particles during floods, describes ingestion and potential physical and chemical effects on organisms, and argues that mitigation requires layered source and transport controls because plastic persistence drives widespread dispersal.
   C. Microplastics benefit river ecosystems by increasing food availability for all species.
   D. A single wastewater upgrade eliminates microplastics in all watersheds.
