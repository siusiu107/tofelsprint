Passage 0080: Microplastics in Rivers and the Problem of Persistence
====================================================================
(Word count: 616)

Microplastics—plastic particles smaller than five millimeters—were first discussed mainly as
an ocean problem, yet rivers are often the more immediate conveyor. They collect fragments
from urban runoff, wastewater, degraded packaging, synthetic textiles, and tire wear,
funneling them through watersheds toward estuaries. Because rivers also support drinking
water supplies, fisheries, and wetlands, microplastics in freshwater raise questions that
are not only ecological but also practical: where do particles go, what do they interact
with, and can exposure be reduced?

Transport depends on size, density, and surface condition. Some particles float initially,
especially low-density polymers, but others sink or become suspended. Sunlight and abrasion
can fragment larger pieces, changing their behavior over time. Moreover, microplastics
quickly acquire biofilms—layers of bacteria and organic matter—that alter density and
stickiness. A particle that was buoyant when fresh can, after biofilm growth and mineral
attachment, settle into sediments. [A] Thus, the “life history” of a fragment matters as
much as its original polymer type.

Rivers are not smooth pipes; they are mosaics of habitats. In fast channels, turbulence
keeps particles suspended, but in slow backwaters and floodplains, sediments accumulate and
so do microplastics. During floods, stored sediments can be remobilized, creating pulses of
downstream transport. In that sense, microplastics can behave like fine silt, alternately
stored and released. This complicates monitoring: a river sampled on a calm day may appear
cleaner than the same river sampled after a storm.

Interactions with organisms are diverse. Some invertebrates ingest particles directly,
mistaking them for food, while fish can consume microplastics indirectly through prey. The
particles can cause physical irritation and can reduce feeding efficiency by occupying gut
space. More subtle concerns involve chemicals. Plastics can contain additives, and they can
sorb pollutants from water, acting as moving surfaces for hydrophobic compounds. Whether
microplastics deliver a significant chemical dose to animals depends on residence time in
the gut, the chemicals involved, and the relative importance of other exposure pathways. [B]
Even when the chemical transfer is modest, the physical presence of persistent particles can
still alter growth or behavior.

Mitigation targets sources. Wastewater treatment plants can capture many fibers, but not
all, and combined sewer overflows during storms can bypass treatment. Street sweeping and
stormwater filters can reduce tire-derived particles and fragments from urban surfaces. At
the consumer level, washing-machine filters and fabric choices can reduce microfiber
release. Because no single intervention blocks every pathway, watershed management tends to
be layered: reduce input, intercept transport, and protect sensitive habitats where
particles accumulate.

Microplastics in rivers illustrate a broader environmental pattern: the same material that
is useful because it resists decay becomes a problem because it persists. [C] The challenge
is not to “ban the river,” but to redesign systems so that persistence does not
automatically imply widespread dispersal. [D]

Questions
---------
1. [Factual] According to the passage, what process can cause a once-buoyant microplastic particle to sink?
   A. biofilm growth and mineral attachment that alter density.
   B. biofilm growth and mineral attachment that alter density. This would require washing-machine to be the limiting factor.
   C. biofilm growth and mineral attachment that alter density. This outcome would hold even if chemicals stays constant.
   D. biofilm growth and mineral attachment that alter density by tying the effect to treatment. This would occur only when problem dominates.


2. [Vocabulary] The word “sorb” in the passage is closest in meaning to:
   A. guarantee a chemical reaction
   B. shatter into dust instantly
   C. absorb or adhere to on a surface
   D. emit as radio pulses

4. [Inference] What can be inferred about why storm sampling may show higher microplastic loads?
   A. Floods can remobilize stored sediments and bypass wastewater treatment, creating transport pulses.
   B. Floods can solely remobilize stored sediments and bypass wastewater treatment, creating transport pulses. That would make rivers the primary constraint.
   C. Floods must remobilize stored sediments and bypass wastewater treatment, creating transport pulses. This would require chemicals to be the limiting factor.

6. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author compare microplastics to fine silt?
   A. To emphasize that particles can be alternately stored in sediments and released during floods, complicating transport and monitoring.
   B. To emphasize that particles can only be alternately stored in sediments and released during floods, complicating transport and monitoring. That would make mitigation the primary constraint.
