Passage 0080: Microplastics in Rivers and the Problem of Persistence
====================================================================
(Word count: 616)

Microplastics—plastic particles smaller than five millimeters—were first discussed mainly as
an ocean problem, yet rivers are often the more immediate conveyor. They collect fragments
from urban runoff, wastewater, degraded packaging, synthetic textiles, and tire wear,
funneling them through watersheds toward estuaries. Because rivers also support drinking
water supplies, fisheries, and wetlands, microplastics in freshwater raise questions that
are not only ecological but also practical: where do particles go, what do they interact
with, and can exposure be reduced?

Transport depends on size, density, and surface condition. Some particles float initially,
especially low-density polymers, but others sink or become suspended. Sunlight and abrasion
can fragment larger pieces, changing their behavior over time. Moreover, microplastics
quickly acquire biofilms—layers of bacteria and organic matter—that alter density and
stickiness. A particle that was buoyant when fresh can, after biofilm growth and mineral
attachment, settle into sediments. [A] Thus, the “life history” of a fragment matters as
much as its original polymer type.

Rivers are not smooth pipes; they are mosaics of habitats. In fast channels, turbulence
keeps particles suspended, but in slow backwaters and floodplains, sediments accumulate and
so do microplastics. During floods, stored sediments can be remobilized, creating pulses of
downstream transport. In that sense, microplastics can behave like fine silt, alternately
stored and released. This complicates monitoring: a river sampled on a calm day may appear
cleaner than the same river sampled after a storm.

Interactions with organisms are diverse. Some invertebrates ingest particles directly,
mistaking them for food, while fish can consume microplastics indirectly through prey. The
particles can cause physical irritation and can reduce feeding efficiency by occupying gut
space. More subtle concerns involve chemicals. Plastics can contain additives, and they can
sorb pollutants from water, acting as moving surfaces for hydrophobic compounds. Whether
microplastics deliver a significant chemical dose to animals depends on residence time in
the gut, the chemicals involved, and the relative importance of other exposure pathways. [B]
Even when the chemical transfer is modest, the physical presence of persistent particles can
still alter growth or behavior.

Mitigation targets sources. Wastewater treatment plants can capture many fibers, but not
all, and combined sewer overflows during storms can bypass treatment. Street sweeping and
stormwater filters can reduce tire-derived particles and fragments from urban surfaces. At
the consumer level, washing-machine filters and fabric choices can reduce microfiber
release. Because no single intervention blocks every pathway, watershed management tends to
be layered: reduce input, intercept transport, and protect sensitive habitats where
particles accumulate.

Microplastics in rivers illustrate a broader environmental pattern: the same material that
is useful because it resists decay becomes a problem because it persists. [C] The challenge
is not to “ban the river,” but to redesign systems so that persistence does not
automatically imply widespread dispersal. [D]

Questions
---------

1. [Vocabulary] In the passage, the word "robust" in the sentence below is closest in meaning to:
   Sentence: Because rivers also support drinking water supplies, fisheries, and wetlands, microplastics in freshwater raise questions that are not only ecological but also practical: where do particles go, what do they interact with, and can exposure be reduced?
   A. durable in a purely physical sense, even though the passage treats it as evidence-related
   B. strong and reliable, as used to describe how the claim holds across particles
   C. finished and beyond revision, which would rule out further evaluation of particles
   D. sensitive and easily disrupted, despite references to fragments and plastic

2. [Prose Summary] Which of the following options best summarizes the passage? (Choose ONE.)
   A. The passage concedes that fragments is often incomplete and concludes that sediments cannot be studied in any meaningful way, since particles overwhelms comparisons. It recommends replacing tests of plastic with intuition because evidence cannot discriminate among accounts.
   B. The passage surveys sediments but treats the discussion mainly as a narrative about who proposed plastic first, with fragments serving as anecdotal color. It therefore treats particles as a historical footnote rather than as something that shapes interpretation, especially regarding sediments.
   C. The passage presents plastic as a uniquely identifying mechanism and claims that once fragments is observed, competing explanations for sediments collapse. It treats particles as minor noise and suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for a final conclusion.
   D. The passage explains sediments by linking fragments to plastic, and it shows why particles changes how the same record is interpreted. It ultimately argues that any evaluation must track how these factors interact rather than treating one signal as decisive.

3. [Inference] The passage suggests which of the following?
   A. The passage implies that particles mattered mostly for early studies, whereas modern work makes fragments effectively self-interpreting. This would mean that tests of plastic no longer need cross-case comparisons to explain sediments, in the context of the passage.
   B. The passage treats fragments primarily as a rhetorical flourish and suggests that debates over plastic are largely stylistic, not empirical. As a result, predictions about sediments are portrayed as optional rather than as a core requirement.
   C. A persuasive account would predict how sediments should change if particles is altered, instead of assuming that fragments has a single meaning. This implies that models tied to plastic must be tested across comparable cases rather than in one favorable setting.
   D. A persuasive account can safely average away differences in particles, because variation there functions mainly as random measurement noise. On this view, a single strong instance of fragments is enough to validate plastic for sediments, for the phenomenon at issue, especially regarding sediments.

4. [Negative Factual Information] The passage mentions each of the following as part of its discussion EXCEPT:
   A. discussion of particles as a factor influencing fragments, as the discussion implies.
   B. discussion of plastic as a factor influencing fragments
   C. discussion of granular convection as a factor influencing fragments
   D. discussion of sediments as a factor influencing fragments

5. [Sentence Simplification] Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the sentence below?
   Sentence: Because rivers also support drinking water supplies, fisheries, and wetlands, microplastics in freshwater raise questions that are not only ecological but also practical: where do particles go, what do they interact with, and can exposure be reduced?
   A. It keeps the details but drops the main relationship, so the key connection becomes unclear.
   B. Because rivers also support drinking water supplies. It reverses the opposite claim while removing extra detail.
   C. Because rivers also support drinking water supplies. It keeps the main claim while removing extra detail.
   D. It implies the outcome is arbitrary and not tied to the factors the author emphasizes in the sentence.

6. [Factual Information] According to the passage, why does the author emphasize comparability across cases?
   A. Because fragments directly measures causes, confounding cannot occur, and cross-case checks add little to understanding sediments.
   B. Because comparability prevents plastic from being treated as self-evident and forces tests that hold particles constant while examining fragments.
   C. Because the presence of plastic guarantees the correct mechanism, so remaining differences in particles are merely stylistic noise.
   D. Because once fragments fits one dataset, replication becomes redundant, and particles can be ignored without changing conclusions about sediments.

7. [Table] The table below summarizes key elements discussed in the passage. Which option correctly fills the blank?
   Table:
   | Category | Role in inference | Typical limitation |
   | Method | comparative tests | May not generalize across contexts |
   | Signal | fragments | Can vary across settings |
   | Confounder | particles | Co-varies with the driver of interest |
   Blank: The limitation for 'Signal' is ________.
   A. It can vary across settings, even when the mechanism is unchanged
   B. It replaces careful evaluation with intuition, so formal checks are unnecessary
   C. It co-varies with the driver of interest, which makes isolation difficult
   D. It proves plastic is unique in every case, so generalization is automatic

8. [Insert Text] Look at the paragraph that contains [A] [B] [C] [D]. Where would the following sentence best fit?
   Sentence to insert: Taken together, this framing implies that sediments should be read alongside particles, because fragments alone does not settle what plastic means.
   A. [A]
   B. [B]
   C. [C]
   D. [D]


9. [Reference] In the passage, the word "This" in the sentence below refers to:
   Sentence: This complicates monitoring: a river sampled on a calm day may appear cleaner than the same river sampled after a storm.
   A. the idea that In that sense, microplastics can behave like fine silt, alternately stored and released
   B. the idea that During floods, stored sediments can be remobilized, creating pulses of downstream transport
   C. the idea that Interactions with organisms are diverse, for the phenomenon at issue, in the cases described.
   D. the idea that Mitigation targets sources, as framed by the author.
10. [Rhetorical Purpose] Why does the author discuss competing interpretations?
   A. to argue that assumptions always distort evidence, so analysis of fragments and plastic should be abandoned altogether.
   B. to motivate clearer assumptions and stronger tests by showing why different readings of fragments lead to different conclusions about sediments.
   C. to show that the term sediments belongs to an unrelated field and is therefore outside the passage’s scope.
   D. to claim that one interpretation uniquely diagnoses plastic, so debate over fragments is unnecessary noise, especially regarding plastic, especially regarding plastic.
