Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Sort of, Hey—quick question about Photochemistry and excited-state pathways. I'm not totally lost, kind of, it's just… the little rules. Like, I guess, the ligand part seems fine, but then the policy mentions transition state and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, sort of, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, book something, or fix something? Because polydispersity matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: I’m glad you asked. Sort of, It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, they pause the workflow. If it's late, they bump you to the next review cycle.
Student 2: Quick tangent: a conference hallway conversation that changed how researchers framed the problem. That's why I screenshot the confirmation page and save the ticket number—catalyst is your friend.
Student 2: Honestly, do it in one clean batch. Uh, Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, you know, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, I guess, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
