Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a professor.

Student: Hi, Professor. Um, do you have a minute? I wanted to ask about reading a chart and avoiding overconfident conclusions.

Professor: Sure. What’s up?

Student: I feel like my work sounds weak, even when I understand the topic.

Professor: Exactly. That usually happens when you describe instead of explain. The professor recommends adding one strong example first.

Professor: A description lists events. An explanation shows a mechanism—why one step leads to the next.

Student: So I need to show the chain, not just the outcome.

Professor: Exactly. Start with one claim, then support it with one specific example. After that, explain why the example supports your claim and not an alternative.

Student: Um, how do I pick a strong example?

Professor: Choose one that is concrete, connected to your claim, and hard to swap out for a different story.

Student: And organization? I jump around.

Professor: Use signposts: ‘first,’ ‘in contrast,’ ‘as a result,’ and ‘to wrap up.’ Those guide the listener and help you stay on track.

Student: Okay. Should I rewrite everything tonight?

Professor: Don’t rewrite everything. Improve one paragraph first. Then copy that pattern.

Student: If I revise tonight, can you glance at it?

Professor: Yes. Send it by tomorrow noon, and I’ll give quick feedback.

Student: Thank you. I’ll do that.
