Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.
Professor: Before we talk about “where an artifact was found,” look at this photo. Bone fragments in the same layer as a modern bottle cap.
Student: That… should not be possible.
Professor: It shouldn’t—if the ground were a sealed box. But soil is more like a busy elevator.
Professor: Here’s an anecdote: a team excavated a site, confidently dated a stone tool, and then discovered the layer had been churned by burrowing animals. Their date wasn’t wrong—the context was.
Student: So animals moved the artifacts?
Professor: Animals, roots, freezing and thawing, even humans digging postholes centuries later. We call it post-depositional movement.
Professor: Now, don’t jump to “then archaeology is hopeless.” It’s not. We look for signals. Are edges sharp or rounded? Are small items concentrated where water would carry them? Do we see a vertical “trail” typical of bioturbation?
Student: How can you tell it’s not just one accidental disturbance?
Professor: Great question. One disturbance is messy but local. Systematic mixing produces patterns across a unit.
Professor: Think of it like shuffling cards. A single sloppy cut changes a few cards; repeated shuffling destroys the original order.
Professor: So when we interpret a find, we ask: is the association between objects primary, or can movement explain it?
Student: That’s… a lot of uncertainty.
Professor: It is. But it’s also realistic. The ground records history, just not in perfect chronological filing cabinets.
