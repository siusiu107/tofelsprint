Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an engineering class.
Professor: (holds up a snapped paperclip) This was not defeated by a giant force. It died from boredom.
Student: Boredom?
Professor: Repetition. Bend it a little, then a little again, and microscopic cracks grow until it fails. That’s metal fatigue.
Professor: Now, if I pulled it once—hard—it might survive. But if I flex it thousands of times, even gently, it breaks.
Student: So small stresses add up.
Professor: Yes, but not by simple addition. The crack growth accelerates because the stress concentrates at the crack tip.
Professor: Let me correct a common misconception: fatigue isn’t the metal “getting tired.” It’s damage accumulating in a specific spot.
Student: Is that why airplane wings are inspected so often?
Professor: Exactly. Engineers design for expected cycles and then inspect for early crack growth.
Professor: So when you hear “it broke for no reason,” it’s often “it broke for the reason you can’t see with your eyes.”
