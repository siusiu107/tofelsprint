  "detail1": "The professor distinguishes mantle convection (a process) from magma chamber (a proxy/measurement).",
  "detail2": "He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving isotope ratio and varve.",
  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",
