Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class.
Professor: Yesterday, a student walked in, soaked from the rain, and said, “Lovely weather.”
Student: That’s sarcasm.
Professor: Sometimes. But imagine the same sentence at a picnic after a week of drought. Same words, different meaning.
Professor: Meaning isn’t glued to the dictionary. It’s negotiated with context—tone, timing, shared knowledge.
Student: So you’re saying words don’t matter?
Professor: No—wait. Words matter. They’re the raw material. Context is the tool that shapes them.
Professor: Quick check: if I say “Nice job” right after you spill coffee on my laptop, what does it mean?
(brief pause)
Professor: Exactly—most of you hear it as criticism. But if I say it after you rescue my laptop from a fall, it’s praise.
Student: So the listener has to infer intent.
Professor: Yes. And that’s why misunderstandings happen: people share words but not assumptions.
Professor: Think of it like traffic signals. A green light usually means go, but if a police officer waves you to stop, context overrides the default rule.
Student: That makes it sound more systematic.
Professor: That’s the point. Context isn’t magic. It’s information—just sometimes unspoken.
