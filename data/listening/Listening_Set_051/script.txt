Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Hey—quick question about Morphosyntax and agreement systems. I'm not totally lost, it's just… the little rules. Like, the register part seems fine, but then the policy mentions syntax and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, book something, or fix something? Because morphology matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: I— I mean’m glad you asked. Uh, It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, kind of, they pause the workflow. If it's late, uh, they bump you to the next review cycle.
Student 2: Quick tangent: a grant requirement that quietly shaped the experiment design. That's why I screenshot the confirmation page and save the ticket number—semantic bleaching is your friend.
Student 2: Honestly, do it in one clean batch. You know, Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Uh, Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, sort of, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
