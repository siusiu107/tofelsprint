Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a campus staff member at the Registrar Office.
Student1: No—no, that’s not my name. That’s… that’s not even spelled like a typo. It’s a different person.
Staff: Okay, take a breath. Show me what you’re looking at.
Student1: Right here. “Name on Record.” It flipped after I submitted the change request. I swear it was correct yesterday.
Staff: Did you submit a request, or did you save a draft?
Student1: I—wait. There was a “Save” button and a “Submit” button. I clicked… I clicked the one that made the page stop yelling at me.
Staff: Mm-hmm. That sounds like Save.
Student1: Ugh. That would explain why I got no confirmation email. I thought the system was just… being itself.
Staff: Not glamorous, but likely. Let’s check your student profile history.
Student1: Please. Because if my transcript prints with “Case Two Mystery Person,” I will evaporate.
Staff: (typing) Okay, I’m seeing a draft change request started… and not finalized.
Student1: So it didn’t actually go through.
Staff: Correct. And the “different person” thing? Sometimes the portal displays a cached record when it times out.
Student1: So I’m panicking over… a ghost screen?
Staff: Possibly. But we won’t guess. We’ll pull your official record from our system.
Student1: Thank you. I need a reality check.
Staff: Official record shows your legal name is unchanged. Good news.
Student1: Oh my gosh—okay. Wait, then why does the portal show the wrong one?
Staff: Because the request was started under the wrong category. See this? “Preferred Name for Email Alias,” not “Transcript Name.”
Student1: Of course. I clicked the wrong one. I was on my phone and the menu was tiny.
Staff: Happens. Here’s what we’ll do: I’ll re-route your draft to the correct queue, and you’ll submit the correct form from a laptop. Then you’ll get a confirmation number.
Student1: So my next step is: laptop, correct category, submit, save the confirmation.
Staff: Exactly. And if the portal keeps showing the wrong display name, you can clear cache or log in from a different browser.
Student1: Cool. Love that my identity depends on browser cookies.
Staff: (laughs) One more thing—do you need this fixed for a deadline?
Student1: Yes. Scholarship application pulls my transcript in two days.
Staff: Then don’t wait. Submit today, and email us the confirmation number. We can flag it so printing uses the official record.
Student1: Okay. I’m… still stressed, but now it’s organized stress.
