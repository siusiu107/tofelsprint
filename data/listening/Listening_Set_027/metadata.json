  "function_phrase": "I’m glad you asked.",
  "main_point": "The professor explains Karst aquifers and sinkhole formation and how to interpret evidence when measurements can be misleading.",
  "detail1": "The professor distinguishes mantle convection (a process) from tomography (a proxy/measurement).",
  "detail2": "He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving isotope ratio and magma chamber.",
  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",
  "organization_point": "He adds a tangent about an ethics aside to show real-world constraints.",
  "connecting_point": "The example about controlling for seismic wave shows how bias can flip an apparent pattern.",
