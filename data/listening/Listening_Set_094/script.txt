Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a film studies class.
Professor: If this topic feels slippery, that’s because it lives right on the boundary between two ideas. You know, Today we're talking about Montage and viewer perception. I'll toss around a couple terms—perception, diegesis, montage—but I'll translate them as we go.
Student 1: Sorry—can I ask something? When you say perception, is that basically pacing, or is it a different mechanism?
Professor: Quick tangent: perception is the process, uh, and pacing is usually a proxy or a measurement for it. People mix them up because the plot looks clean, but the causality is messy.
Professor: Quick tangent: a tangent about the tool or instrument and what it cannot measure. That’s why framing and cut matter—those are constraints, not trivia.
Professor: They redo the protocol: randomize order, like, blind the analysis, add an internal standard. You know, Only after that do they treat the shift in continuity as real rather than an artifact.
Professor: Like, Let’s frame it as a case. A team collects samples, sort of, builds a pipeline, and expects a clean result. I guess, Instead they see dependence on framing. First they blame noise, then they realize the sampling window biased the baseline.
Professor: Anyone want to take a stab at it?
Professor: …Yeah. No volunteers. Love that energy.
Student 2: So if we’re choosing between two explanations, what’s the fastest way to falsify one without running a whole new study?
Professor: Good. Look for an asymmetric prediction. Explanation A implies a change in narrative even if diegesis stays constant; Explanation B doesn’t. Design a small test around that hinge point.
Professor: Anyway, to wrap up: Montage and viewer perception is less about one fact and more about reasoning under constraints. Watch the proxies, watch the instruments, and don’t fall in love with one pretty plot.
