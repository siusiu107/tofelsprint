Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a staff member at an IT help desk.
Student1: Okay, I’m clicking “Reset password.” It says it emailed me. I check my inbox—nothing. I click again. Now it says “Too many attempts.”
Staff: Stop clicking. The system thinks you’re an attacker.
Student1: Great. I’m hacking my own account.
Staff: Do you have more than one university email?
Student1: …Maybe. I had an old alias from freshman year.
Staff: That’s probably where the reset is going. What’s the alias?
Student1: Uh… it’s like my initials plus “02.” I never use it.
Staff: Let’s verify. Also, are you on campus Wi‑Fi?
Student1: Yes, and it keeps dropping for half a second. Just enough to ruin my life.
Staff: Okay, two issues. First: we’ll update the recovery email to your current address. Second: for the Wi‑Fi, switch to the “secure” network and forget the old one.
Student1: Can you do the email change right now?
Staff: I can submit it, but you’ll need to confirm with your student ID. If the account is locked, we may have to unlock it manually.
Student1: I have a quiz in twenty minutes.
Staff: Then here’s the fastest route: I’ll unlock the account, set a temporary password, and you change it after you log in. Don’t try more resets in the meantime.
Student1: Deal. I’m going to put my hands in my pockets so I can’t click.
