Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Hey—quick question about Operant conditioning schedules and extinction. I'm not totally lost, like, it's just… the little rules. Like, sort of, the baseline part seems fine, but then the policy mentions priming and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, like, book something, or fix something? I guess, Because attentional blink matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, um, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: Like, Let me back up for a second. It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, they pause the workflow. If it's late, I guess, they bump you to the next review cycle.
Student 2: Honestly, you know, do it in one clean batch. Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Oh, also… I got an email about housing verification and it freaked me out. Uh, Is that normal?
Student 2: Yeah, that's normal. The system sends scary emails even when nothing is wrong.
Student 1: Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, uh, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Kind of, Exactly. And if you want, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
