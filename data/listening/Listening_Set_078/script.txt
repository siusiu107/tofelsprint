Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Hey—quick question about MRI artifacts and signal-to-noise tradeoffs. I'm not totally lost, I guess, it's just… the little rules. Like, the confounding part seems fine, but then the policy mentions randomization and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, like, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, book something, or fix something? Because specificity matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: S-Sort Sort— of, Let me back up for a second. I guess, It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, they pause the workflow. If it's late, they bump you to the next review cycle.
Student 2: Quick tangent: a conference hallway conversation that changed how researchers framed the problem. Sort of, That's why I screenshot the confirmation page and save the ticket number—superspreading is your friend.
Student 2: Honestly, do it in one clean batch. Kind of, Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Sort of, Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: I guess, Exactly. And if you want, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
