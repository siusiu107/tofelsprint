Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a university employee.

Student: Hi. Um, I’m here about renewal requirements, GPA rules, and documentation.

Nurse: That’s a common issue. Tell me what you’ve tried so far.

Student: I followed the instructions online, but the system still shows a problem and I’m worried about the deadline.

Nurse: Okay. First, don’t panic. The staff says one missing form can trigger an automatic hold.

Nurse: Here’s what we’ll do: step one, I’ll check your account. Step two, we try a quick fix. Step three, if that fails, we submit the formal request today so it’s timestamped.

Student: What counts as a formal request?

Nurse: Usually a ticket or a form that enters the queue. It takes longer, but it’s trackable.

Student: And the quick fix is…?

Nurse: Things like clearing a stuck hold, verifying one field, or re‑sending a confirmation.

Student: If we submit today, am I safe with the deadline?

Nurse: If it’s timestamped today, you’re protected. Also, keep any confirmation email—those timestamps matter.

Student: Okay. I have screenshots.

Nurse: Screenshots help, but if you have an email, that’s even better. Let’s try the quick fix now.

Student: Thanks. I really appreciate it.
