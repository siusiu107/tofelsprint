Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in an economics class.
Professor: I can hear the groans already. Yes, the café’s “free drink day” caused a line that wrapped around the building.
Student: I waited forty minutes and then left.
Professor: Perfect. You just described the hidden cost.
Professor: Companies love the word “free,” because demand spikes. But capacity—machines, staff, time—doesn’t magically expand.
Student: So “free” makes people angry?
Professor: Not automatically. It makes expectations louder. If you expect a quick drink and you get uncertainty—“Will it take ten minutes or an hour?”—that uncertainty feels like a cost.
Professor: Actually, let me correct myself: the wait time is a cost; the uncertainty is an extra cost layered on top.
Student: Then what’s the smart move?
Professor: Give a clear estimate. Or limit the offer. Or schedule it so the system can handle the demand.
Professor: Here’s a quick scenario. If you were the manager, would you rather say “free refills all day” or “free refills between 2 and 4”?
Student: The second one.
Professor: Exactly. Narrowing the window reduces load and lets customers plan. “Free” still attracts—but the line doesn’t become a public-relations disaster.
Professor: So the lesson isn’t “never offer free things.” It’s “don’t ignore capacity and human expectations.”
