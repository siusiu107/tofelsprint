Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students in a computer lab.
Student1: They literally waved me away. Like—hand up, “nope,” gone.
Student2: At the event? Why?
Student1: My wristband is blue. They said tonight is red only.
Student2: Didn’t you sign up for the volunteer shift? Volunteers get blue.
Student1: I signed up to attend. My cousin is performing, I’m not trying to work.
Student2: Okay, show me your confirmation email.
Student1: (typing) Here. “General Admission—Red band at check-in.”
Student2: Then the check-in table messed up.
Student1: The volunteer guy kept saying “blue means staff.” I was like, “I am not staff, I’m emotionally fragile.”
Student2: (laughs) Did you keep the receipt or QR code?
Student1: I have the QR. They scanned it and still gave me blue.
Student2: Then the fix is: go back to the table, ask for a supervisor, and show the email line. Don’t argue at the gate.
Student1: I did argue at the gate.
Student2: I can tell.
Student1: So… is there a way to swap it without losing my place?
Student2: If the event’s full, you might have to step aside. But you can ask them to hold your spot while you swap the band.
Student1: Great. So I need to be calm and strategic.
Student2: Exactly. And if they refuse, ask for a refund or a comp ticket. But start with “I think my band was issued wrong at check-in.”
Student1: Okay. I’m going back. If I disappear, tell my cousin I died trying.
Student2: Dramatic. Go.
