Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Hey—quick question about Transit photometry and exoplanet radius estimates. I'm not totally lost, it's just… the little rules. Like, um, the redshift part seems fine, but then the policy mentions eccentricity and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, book something, or fix something? Because Keplerian matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: Think of it this way: It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, I guess, they pause the workflow. If it's late, they bump you to the next review cycle—No, wait, I meant Keplerian, not magnetosphere.
Student 2: Honestly, do it in one clean batch. Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, like, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Uh, Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, um, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, I guess, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
