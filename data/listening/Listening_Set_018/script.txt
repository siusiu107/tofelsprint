Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a marketing class.
Professor: “This product is green.” Sounds good, right?
Student: Usually, yeah.
Professor: Here’s the twist: sometimes labeling a product as “eco-friendly” makes people use more of it.
Student: How?
Professor: They feel less guilty. It’s a psychological rebound. “It’s green, so an extra long shower is fine.” Or “it’s biodegradable, so I can buy more.”
Professor: Let me slow down—this isn’t saying people are bad. It’s saying labels change behavior in ways companies don’t anticipate.
Student: So the label backfires.
Professor: Exactly. And if the product is only slightly better, increased use can cancel the benefit.
Professor: That’s why credible “green” strategies consider the whole system: production, use, disposal, and behavior.
Student: Then what should companies do?
Professor: Be specific. “Uses 30% less water to manufacture” is better than a vague halo. And pair claims with design that discourages waste.
