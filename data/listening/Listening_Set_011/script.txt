Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a campus staff member in a dorm hallway.
Student1: If I pass out, tell people it was the radiator. It’s like a sauna in my room.
Staff: You look sweaty—okay, what’s happening?
Student1: The heater is stuck on full blast. I turned the dial to zero and it laughed at me.
Staff: Did you try opening the window?
Student1: Yes. Now it’s hot and windy. I’m living in a hair dryer.
Staff: All right. Sometimes the valve sticks. If you tap it gently—
Student1: I tapped it. Then I apologized to it. Nothing.
Staff: (chuckles) Okay. I can put in a maintenance request, but I need your room number and whether it’s making noise or leaking.
Student1: No leak. Just aggression.
Staff: Good. Until they come, put a towel over the vent and keep the door cracked so heat doesn’t build up.
Student1: That feels… illegal.
Staff: It’s temporary. Also, if it’s truly unbearable tonight, we can move you to an empty guest room for one night. Not forever—just to sleep.
Student1: Wait, that’s an option?
Staff: Yes, but it depends on availability. Maintenance usually fixes this fast.
Student1: Okay. Let’s do the request first. If they don’t show, I’ll beg for the guest room.
Staff: Deal. And don’t try to dismantle the heater.
Student1: I make no promises. I’m kidding. Mostly.
