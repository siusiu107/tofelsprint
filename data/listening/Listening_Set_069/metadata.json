  "detail1": "The professor distinguishes runoff (a process) from sequestration (a proxy/measurement).",
  "detail2": "He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving hypoxia and bioaccumulation.",
  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",
  "organization_point": "He adds a tangent about a historical aside to show real-world constraints.",
  "connecting_point": "The example about controlling for eutrophication shows how bias can flip an apparent pattern.",
