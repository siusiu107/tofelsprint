Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Hey—quick question about Prosody and information structure. I'm not totally lost, it's just… the little rules. Like, kind of, the implicature part seems fine, but then the policy mentions syntax and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, you know, book something, or fix something? Because semantic bleaching matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: That’s a fair point, but It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, they pause the workflow. If it's late, they bump you to the next review cycle—No, wait, I meant pragmatics, not syntax.
Student 2: Honestly, uh, do it in one clean batch. Kind of, Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, kind of, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Oh, kind of, also… I got an email about housing verification and it freaked me out. Is that normal?
Student 2: Honestly, professors are drowning right now. But you could just send a short email.
Student 1: Like, Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
