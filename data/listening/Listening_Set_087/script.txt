Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Hey—quick question about Neutrino oscillations and flavor states. I'm not totally lost, it's just… the little rules. Like, uh, the oscillation part seems fine, but then the policy mentions interference and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, book something, or fix something? Because resonance matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: Right, and that matters because It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, uh, they pause the workflow. If it's late, they bump you to the next review cycle.
Student 2: Honestly, um, do it in one clean batch. Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, I guess, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Wait, um, random question—has Professor Lee been okay? They looked… exhausted last class.
Student 2: Honestly, I guess, professors are drowning right now. But you could just send a short email.
Student 1: Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, sort of, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
