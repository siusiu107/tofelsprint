Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Uh, Hey—quick question about Corpus linguistics and frequency effects. I'm not totally lost, kind of, it's just… the little rules. Like, um, the corpus part seems fine, but then the policy mentions semantic bleaching and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, book something, or fix something? Um, Because morphology matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: Quick tangent: It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, you know, they pause the workflow. If it's late, they bump you to the next review cycle.
Student 2: Uh, Quick tangent: a minor lab mishap—like someone labeling tubes backwards—that forced the team to rethink their protocol. Uh, That's why I screenshot the confirmation page and save the ticket number—prosody is your friend.
Student 2: Honestly, you know, do it in one clean batch. Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, sort of, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Wait, sort of, random question—has Professor Lee been okay? Kind of, They looked… exhausted last class.
Student 2: For reimbursements, there's always some weird rule. Talk to the student activities office.
Student 1: Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, um, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
