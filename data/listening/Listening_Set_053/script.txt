Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students.

Student 1: Um, Jordan, do you have a minute? I'm stressed about resetting roles after someone missed a meeting and the timeline slipped.

Student 2: Yeah, sure. What happened?

Student 1: I thought we were done, but I just saw a message that changes the plan. Now I’m not sure we’re covered.

Student 2: Okay, let’s not panic. What’s the deadline?

Student 1: Today, basically. If we mess up, it’ll snowball into next week.

Student 2: Got it. Two options?

Student 1: One is fast but risky. The other is slower but way safer.

Student 2: If we choose the fast one, what’s the worst case?

Student 1: We miss a requirement and have to redo everything. That would actually cost more time.

Student 2: So you're saying… So the ‘safe’ option might be faster overall.

Student 1: Right. I also think we should write down who’s doing what, just to avoid confusion.

Student 2: Agreed. Tiny checklist: confirm the latest info, assign tasks, set a cutoff time, and choose a backup plan.

Student 1: I can confirm the latest info right now and send you a screenshot.

Student 2: Perfect. I’ll draft the message and you can edit it for tone.

Student 1: And if no one replies?

Student 2: Then we use the backup plan at 5 p.m. No waiting forever.

Student 1: Okay. That makes me feel a lot better.

Student 2: Cool. So basically, They realize a misunderstanding caused the problem and reset responsibilities.

Student 1: Exactly. I’ll message you in ten minutes.
