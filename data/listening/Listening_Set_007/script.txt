Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a campus staff member in the music building corridor.
Staff: Hey—are these yours? I heard them clanking down the hall.
Student1: Oh! Yes—wait, no—mine have a little… weird keychain. Like a tiny rubber dinosaur.
Staff: This has… a metal star and a ripped tag.
Student1: That’s my tag! The dinosaur fell off yesterday. I thought it got eaten by the couch.
Staff: So you lost the keys and the keychain separately.
Student1: My life is a scavenger hunt.
Staff: Okay, what’s on the tag?
Student1: It used to have my dorm and phone number. Now it’s just… fuzz and heartbreak.
Staff: Then we verify by what the keys open. Do you have a spare?
Student1: My roommate does. But she’s in rehearsal and won’t check her phone for three hours.
Staff: We can do a quick test: there’s a practice-room key on here, right? If it fits the second-floor room, that’s a strong clue.
Student1: I’m down. Anything to avoid paying for a rekey.
Staff: Fair. But if it’s not yours, don’t force it. We’ll hand it to lost-and-found with a note: “tag ripped, keychain missing.”
Student1: What if someone finds the dinosaur later?
Staff: Then you’ll have the world’s saddest reunion. But yes—leave your name at the desk. If the keychain turns up, we can match it.
Student1: Okay. Let’s test the practice-room key. If it works, I’m naming you my hero for the day.
Staff: No pressure. Let’s go.
