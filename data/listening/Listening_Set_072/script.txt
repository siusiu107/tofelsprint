Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: I guess, Hey—quick question about Renewable intermittency and grid balancing. I'm not totally lost, kind of, it's just… the little rules. Like, the runoff part seems fine, but then the policy mentions hypoxia and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, book something, or fix something? Um, Because albedo matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, uh, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: Exactly. It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, uh, they pause the workflow. If it's late, like, they bump you to the next review cycle—No, wait, I meant hypoxia, not intermittency.
Student 2: Honestly, sort of, do it in one clean batch. Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: And—this is embarrassing—my account has a hold. Do you know what usually causes that?
Student 2: For reimbursements, there's always some weird rule. Kind of, Talk to the student activities office.
Student 1: Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, I guess, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
