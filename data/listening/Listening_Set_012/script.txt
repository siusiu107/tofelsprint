Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class.
Professor: Two people watch the same event. One says the car was red. The other swears it was black. Which one is lying?
Student: Maybe neither?
Professor: Exactly. And that’s why eyewitness testimony can be tricky.
Professor: Let’s do a mini-test. I’m going to describe a scene quickly, and then I’ll ask a detail. Ready?
Professor: “A person jogs past a café, drops a set of keys, and a cyclist rings a bell.” Okay—what color was the jogger’s shirt?
(awkward pause)
Professor: See? You’re already guessing. You didn’t hear a color, but your brain wants a complete picture.
Student: So memory fills in blanks.
Professor: Yes. And it’s not just blanks. Stress narrows attention. People remember the “threat” and miss the background.
Professor: Now, here’s a correction I should make: it’s not that memory is a video recorder that “fails.” It’s that memory is reconstructive from the start.
Student: Then how do investigators use witnesses at all?
Professor: They use careful interviewing—open questions, no leading language, and multiple independent accounts. And they treat confidence as imperfect evidence.
Professor: So disagreement doesn’t automatically mean dishonesty. Sometimes it just means two brains built two different stories from the same noisy input.
