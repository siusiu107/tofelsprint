  "main_point": "The professor explains Pulsar timing arrays and nanohertz gravitational waves and how to interpret evidence when measurements can be misleading.",
  "detail1": "The professor distinguishes eccentricity (a process) from orbital period (a proxy/measurement).",
  "detail2": "He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving signal-to-noise ratio and Keplerian.",
  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",
  "organization_point": "He adds a tangent about a funding detail to show real-world constraints.",
  "connecting_point": "The example about controlling for magnetosphere shows how bias can flip an apparent pattern.",
