  "detail1": "The professor distinguishes chemical shift (a process) from transition state (a proxy/measurement).",
  "detail2": "He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving polydispersity and adsorption isotherm.",
  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",
  "organization_point": "He adds a tangent about a real-world constraint to show real-world constraints.",
  "connecting_point": "The example about controlling for photolysis shows how bias can flip an apparent pattern.",
