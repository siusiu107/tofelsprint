Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Hey—quick question about Price discrimination and consumer surplus. I'm not totally lost, like, it's just… the little rules. Like, uh, the network effect part seems fine, but then the policy mentions marginal cost and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, you know, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, book something, or fix something? Kind of, Because consumer surplus matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, uh, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: Let’s test that intuition. It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, kind of, they pause the workflow. If it's late, you know, they bump you to the next review cycle—No, wait, I meant incentive, not hedging.
Student 2: Quick tangent: a conference hallway conversation that changed how researchers framed the problem. That's why I screenshot the confirmation page and save the ticket number—hedging is your friend.
Student 2: Honestly, I guess, do it in one clean batch. Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, I guess, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Oh, also… I got an email about housing verification and it freaked me out. Is that normal?
Student 2: I think it's appointment-only, but the front desk sometimes lets you squeeze in.
Student 1: Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, you know, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, like, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
