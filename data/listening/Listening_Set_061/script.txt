Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Hey—quick question about Placebo effects and expectancy. I'm not totally lost, it's just… the little rules. Like, the sunk cost part seems fine, but then the policy mentions reinforcement and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, I guess, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, uh, book something, or fix something? Because cognitive load matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: Um, Think of it this way: It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, they pause the workflow. If it's late, uh, they bump you to the next review cycle—No, wait, I meant placebo, not reinforcement.
Student 2: Quick tangent: a grant requirement that quietly shaped the experiment design. That's why I screenshot the confirmation page and save the ticket number—extinction is your friend.
Student 2: Honestly, do it in one clean batch. Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: One more thing: I need an immunization form signed, sort of, but the clinic portal is confusing.
Student 2: The clinic portal is terrible. If you bring the form in person, it's faster.
Student 1: Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, like, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
