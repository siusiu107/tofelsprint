Narrator: Listen to a lecture in a class.

Professor: Good morning. This is PSYC 101, and we're in Hawthorne Hall. Before we start, remember: the reading for next time is on the course site.

Professor: Today we're talking about proofs, counterexamples, and why intuition can mislead. I’m going to define one key term, walk through two examples, and then give you a quick way to check your own reasoning.

Professor: The key term is 'feedback loop'. In this class, a feedback loop is the specific part of a system that produces the effect we observe. It’s not just a fancy label—it's something you could test.

Professor: The first piece, here’s the common trap. People see two things move together and assume one causes the other. But correlation just means they change together. Causation means changing one reliably changes the other, even when you control other factors.

Professor: Example one: imagine two neighborhoods that look similar but have different incentives. If you don’t measure a baseline first, you might think your intervention worked when you’re really just seeing normal variation.

Student: Um, when you say baseline, do you mean like the starting numbers?

Professor: Exactly. Baseline means a measurement you can repeat before you change anything. It gives you a fair comparison.

Professor: Example two: consider a historical case study with incomplete records. You can get a clean‑looking result that’s still wrong if a hidden constraint is doing the work. The constraint might be timing, access, or incentives.

Professor: in a different case, if you identify the constraint, your explanation suddenly predicts new outcomes. That’s how you know you’re closer to the real mechanism.

Professor: Here’s the quick reasoning check I want you to practice: one, what exactly was measured? two, what mechanism could produce it? three, what alternative explanation also fits? four, what would you expect next if your mechanism is true?

Professor: Are you with me so far? On listening exams, those four questions help you answer main idea, detail, inference, and organization questions without guessing.

Professor: Finally, listen for signposts like 'first,' 'in contrast,' and 'to wrap up.' They tell you what the speaker is doing—defining, comparing, giving an example, or summarizing.

Professor: To wrap up: start with a simple explanation that fits the evidence, then test it. If it fails, revise. That’s not a flaw—that’s how research works.
