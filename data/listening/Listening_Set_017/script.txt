Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students outside an empty classroom.
Student1: Okay, either I’m early by an hour, or the class collectively vanished.
Student2: You’re in the right room. The professor moved today online.
Student1: What? I never saw that.
Student2: It was posted—uh, not in announcements. In the “Resources” tab. Which is… a choice.
Student1: I checked announcements like a normal person.
Student2: Same. I found it by accident because I was looking for the homework.
Student1: Speaking of homework—the assignment isn’t where it usually is.
Student2: Yeah, it’s in the wrong section. I thought it was missing, then realized it’s under last week’s module.
Student1: That’s evil.
Student2: I don’t think it’s evil. I think it’s messy.
Student1: So what do we do? Just guess?
Student2: Screenshot where it is, message the class chat with the exact path, and email the professor politely: “It’s hard to locate; could you pin it?”
Student1: Okay. I’ll post the path. You email.
Student2: Deal. Also, since we’re already here, want to grab a table and work? The building is quiet.
Student1: Honestly, yes. At least the empty classroom won’t move tabs on us.
