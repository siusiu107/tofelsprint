Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a campus staff member in an advising lobby.
Student1: I got the grade back already. It’s… chopped. Like, ten points gone.
Staff: Whoa—okay. Sit. What class?
Student1: Our group report. The portal shows “late penalty,” but we submitted before midnight. I’m staring at the timestamp like it’s going to apologize.
Staff: Did you submit the final file, or save it as a draft?
Student1: That’s the thing. We uploaded it, clicked “Save,” and it showed up in the list. We assumed that meant done.
Staff: Mmm. Some systems treat “Save” as “not submitted.” There’s usually a separate “Submit to instructor.”
Student1: Nobody told us there were two buttons. It’s like… a trap door.
Staff: It’s not a trap, but it is bad design.
Student1: And now the request I filed went… somewhere else? I got an auto-reply from the financial aid office.
Staff: Wait—you filed it under “payment issues,” didn’t you?
Student1: I clicked the first thing that sounded urgent.
Staff: That would route it wrong. Here—let me pull up the form.
Student1: (phone buzzes) Sorry—my teammate is calling. If I don’t answer, they’ll spiral.
Staff: Go ahead.
Student1: (to phone) Yes, I’m here. No, I’m not yelling at them. Not yet. I’m getting info. Okay—text me the screenshot. Bye.
Staff: Okay. New plan: don’t keep pinging random offices. I’ll re-route your ticket to the learning platform team, and you should email the instructor with two pieces of evidence: your upload timestamp and the page showing it was still a draft.
Student1: So it’s “here’s proof, please remove penalty,” not “we’re innocent, trust us.”
Staff: Exactly. And if the instructor can’t change it, the platform team can confirm the submission state.
Student1: Great. I came in furious and now I have… a checklist. That helps.
