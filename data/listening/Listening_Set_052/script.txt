Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a linguistics class.
Professor: Kind of, Let’s start with a mistake—one I made when I was a graduate student. Today we're talking about Semantic shift and lexical bleaching. I'll toss around a couple terms—corpus, you know, elicitation, register—but I'll translate them as we go.
Student 1: Sorry—can I ask something? When you say corpus, sort of, is that basically morphology, or is it a different mechanism?
Professor: T-Think Think— of it this way: corpus is the process, sort of, and morphology is usually a proxy or a measurement for it. People mix them up because the plot looks clean, uh, but the causality is messy.
Professor: Quick tangent: a grant requirement that quietly shaped the experiment design. That’s why syntax and prosody matter—those are constraints, kind of, not trivia.
Professor: Here’s the story version. You notice an odd shift in semantic bleaching. Then you ask what could plausibly produce it: changes in elicitation, hidden variation in pragmatics, or bias from phoneme. The trick is tracking which explanation would leave which fingerprint.
Professor: For example, you know, two samples can look identical until you use a higher-resolution method. The moment you control for prosody, the pattern flips, and that flip is basically the clue.
Professor: So… what’s the catch here?
Professor: …Okay, that's fine. We'll do it together.
Student 2: So if we’re choosing between two explanations, what’s the fastest way to falsify one without running a whole new study?
Professor: Good. Look for an asymmetric prediction. Like, Explanation A implies a change in pragmatics even if elicitation stays constant; Explanation B doesn’t. Design a small test around that hinge point.
Professor: Anyway, to wrap up: Semantic shift and lexical bleaching is less about one fact and more about reasoning under constraints. Watch the proxies, watch the instruments, and don’t fall in love with one pretty plot.
