  "main_point": "The professor explains Carbon sequestration in peatlands and how to interpret evidence when measurements can be misleading.",
  "detail1": "The professor distinguishes hypoxia (a process) from bioaccumulation (a proxy/measurement).",
  "detail2": "He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving salinity and runoff.",
  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",

  "connecting_point": "The example about controlling for intermittency shows how bias can flip an apparent pattern.",
