Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students in a campus café.
Student1: Okay, so you said “3 p.m.” and I showed up at 3 p.m. and you were… in another dimension.
Student2: I wasn’t ghosting you! My calendar said 3 p.m. too.
Student1: Then why did the meeting link say “2 a.m.” when I clicked it last night?
Student2: Wait, what? Show me.
Student1: (slides phone) See? It says “3 p.m. UTC.”
Student2: Oh no. My settings—my laptop is still on “London” from winter break. That’s… embarrassing.
Student1: So we’ve been scheduling across time zones while sitting in the same city.
Student2: Yeah. That explains why I’ve been late to everything this week.
Student1: Okay, new problem: the professor’s office hour. I booked the only slot.
Student2: Don’t cancel it. Just email and say you had a time zone display issue.
Student1: Will they believe that?
Student2: If you include a screenshot and propose two new times, yes. Also, fix your device settings right now.
Student1: I did. I just toggled “set automatically.” It feels like defusing a tiny bomb.
Student2: And for our group meeting, let’s stop using time-zone-coded invites. We’ll text a plain sentence: “Thursday at 3 p.m. campus time.”
Student1: “Campus time” should be a real setting.
Student2: Honestly. Also—if you’re worried about looking flaky, say you’re confirming because the invite displayed differently on your phone.
Student1: Okay. So we’re not rescheduling because we’re disorganized. We’re rescheduling because technology is… creative.
Student2: Exactly. Now buy me a coffee and I’ll forgive you for the “another dimension” line.
