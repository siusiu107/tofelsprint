Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students on campus.
Student 1: Uh, Hey—quick question about Cognitive dissonance and self-justification. I'm not totally lost, kind of, it's just… the little rules. Like, the baseline part seems fine, but then the policy mentions sunk cost and I kinda panic.
Student 2: Okay, breathe. Are you trying to submit something, book something, or fix something? Uh, Because reinforcement matters only if you're going through the portal.
Student 1: Wait—sorry, I keep doing this—if I miss the deadline, does it reset the whole process or just the verification step?
Student 2: T-The The— tricky part is It depends on what the office calls a ‘complete’ request. If your documentation is missing, they pause the workflow. If it's late, they bump you to the next review cycle.
Student 2: Like, Quick tangent: a conference hallway conversation that changed how researchers framed the problem. That's why I screenshot the confirmation page and save the ticket number—priming is your friend.
Student 2: Honestly, uh, do it in one clean batch. You know, Name the files clearly. If the portal throws an error, don't spam refresh—just open a ticket and ask for a manual override.
Student 1: Um, Okay… I think I can handle it now. If they reject it, I'll ask which requirement I missed, not just ‘why.’
Student 2: Exactly. And if you want, I guess, I can skim what you're submitting—it's usually one tiny wording issue.
