  "detail2": "He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving failure mode and impedance.",
  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",

  "connecting_point": "The example about controlling for tolerance shows how bias can flip an apparent pattern.",
