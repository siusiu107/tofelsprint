Narrator: Listen to a conversation between a student and a campus staff member at a dining office window.
Student1: I’m not trying to be dramatic, but my meal plan is bleeding money.
Staff: Okay—what happened?
Student1: I bought the same salad twice this week. One day it was normal. Yesterday it rang up as a “special item” with an extra charge.
Staff: Do you have the receipts?
Student1: Yeah. Look—same name, same picture, different price.
Staff: Huh. The “allergy-safe” label might be triggering a different item code.
Student1: Allergy-safe? I didn’t ask for anything special. I just… don’t want to die.
Staff: Right. If your profile has an allergy flag, the system sometimes routes you to a modified preparation line. That can attach a different code.
Student1: So my peanut allergy is costing me extra?
Staff: It shouldn’t. That sounds like a configuration error.
Student1: Can you fix it? Because I’m not paying a tax for having an immune system.
Staff: (laughs) Fair. Here’s what we do: I’ll check your profile settings. If the flag is tied to the wrong menu item, we correct the mapping and refund the difference for the last charges.
Student1: Refund would be amazing.
Staff: Also, for today, I can give you a manual credit so you’re not stuck waiting for the system update.
Student1: Okay. I came in mad, but that’s… actually helpful.
