   B. To summarize the reading assignment
   C. To criticize a student for interrupting
   D. He adds a tangent about a funding detail to show real-world constraints.

Q7. (Connecting Content) What does the example illustrate?
   A. It changes the topic to a different unit of the course.
   B. It is an unrelated anecdote meant to entertain the class.
   C. It shows historical background that is not connected to the concept.
   D. The example about controlling for conductance shows how bias can flip an apparent pattern.

Q8. (Detail) According to the speaker, what is one key detail about the situation?
   A. He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving photorespiration and stomata.
   B. The speaker says the method works only in a controlled lab environment.
