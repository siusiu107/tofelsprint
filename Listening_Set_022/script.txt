Narrator: Listen to part of a lecture in a archaeology class.
Professor: If this topic feels slippery, um, that’s because it lives right on the boundary between two ideas. Sort of, Today we're talking about Stable isotope analysis of ancient diets. I'll toss around a couple terms—provenance, taphonomy, assemblage—but I'll translate them as we go.
Student 1: Sort of, Sorry—can I ask something? When you say provenance, is that basically dendrochronology, or is it a different mechanism?
Professor: I guess, Let’s test that intuition. provenance is the process, and dendrochronology is usually a proxy or a measurement for it. People mix them up because the plot looks clean, like, but the causality is messy.
Professor: Quick tangent: a minor lab mishap—like someone labeling tubes backwards—that forced the team to rethink their protocol. That’s why stratigraphy and calibration curve matter—those are constraints, not trivia.
Professor: For example, two samples can look identical until you use a higher-resolution method. The moment you control for calibration curve, the pattern flips, and that flip is basically the clue.
Professor: Here’s the story version. Sort of, You notice an odd shift in radiocarbon dating. Then you ask what could plausibly produce it: changes in taphonomy, I guess, hidden variation in typology, or bias from GIS. Uh, The trick is tracking which explanation would leave which fingerprint.
Professor: Okay—why does that matter for the model?
Professor: …Yeah. No volunteers. Love that energy.
Student 2: So if we’re choosing between two explanations, like, what’s the fastest way to falsify one without running a whole new study?
Professor: Good. Look for an asymmetric prediction. Explanation A implies a change in typology even if taphonomy stays constant; Explanation B doesn’t. Um, Design a small test around that hinge point.
Professor: Anyway, to wrap up: Stable isotope analysis of ancient diets is less about one fact and more about reasoning under constraints. Watch the proxies, watch the instruments, and don’t fall in love with one pretty plot.
