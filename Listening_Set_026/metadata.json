  "function_phrase": "Don’t get hung up on the numbers—",
  "main_point": "The professor explains Paleomagnetism and geomagnetic reversals and how to interpret evidence when measurements can be misleading.",
  "detail1": "The professor distinguishes mantle convection (a process) from lithosphere (a proxy/measurement).",
  "detail2": "He suggests testing an asymmetric prediction involving subduction and karst.",
  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",
  "organization_point": "He adds a tangent about a conference anecdote to show real-world constraints.",
  "connecting_point": "The example about controlling for seismic wave shows how bias can flip an apparent pattern.",
