  "main_point": "The professor explains Taphonomy and post-depositional processes and how to interpret evidence when measurements can be misleading.",
  "detail1": "The professor distinguishes stratigraphy (a process) from calibration curve (a proxy/measurement).",

  "attitude": "Casual but analytical; he warns against over-trusting a neat correlation.",
